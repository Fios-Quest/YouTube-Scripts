Job Tracker 06
==============

Reminder:
---------

Project is planned to be monetised (donate but free to use)

Goals:
------

Before we get started:
- [x] Do people want to see how I did the store?
- [x] Storage and log bugs
- [x] Setting up Dependabot

Actual Tailwind Stuff:
- [x] Discuss set up and problems (intellij, git/ci/cd)
- [x] Discuss loose layout
- [x] Test out how utility functions can be reused for consistent theming
- [ ] Create a loose theme
- [ ] Work out how to make tailwind.css ignored

By the end:
- [ ] Decide if Tailwind is right for Job Tracker

Next time?
----------

Options:

- Rest of the storage types we need?
- Diving into window control (keyboard input etc)
- Packaging and releasing (probably too early)
- Other suggestions?
