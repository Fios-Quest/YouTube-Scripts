<h2 id="preamble"><a class="header" href="#preamble">Preamble</a></h2>
<p>The Rust programming language has a bit of a reputation: it's hard to learn.</p>
<p>Certainly, when I learned Rust in 2017, I struggled with it.</p>
<p>But its 2024 now, I think things have changed.</p>
<p>I'm putting my time where my mouth is and making a series teaching Rust as quickly and, I hope, painlessly as possible.</p>
<p>This series has a free accompanying book, check the description below.</p>
<p>I'm Daniel, welcome to IRISS.</p>
<h2 id="why--why-not"><a class="header" href="#why--why-not">Why / Why Not</a></h2>
<p>We're not going to jump into coding today though.</p>
<p>Sorry, in TTRPG terms, this is session zero.</p>
<p>I want to talk about why you should or should not learn Rust</p>
<p>what other learning resources are out there</p>
<p>and how this series is going to compare</p>
<h3 id="why-rust"><a class="header" href="#why-rust">Why Rust</a></h3>
<p>So why <em>should</em> you learn Rust?</p>
<p>I could tell you that:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's blazingly fast</li>
<li>It holds your hand and makes it hard to make mistakes</li>
<li>Its first party tooling is second to none</li>
<li>It has a mature ecosystem of tools and libraries</li>
<li>And it has an amazingly kind and supportive community</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these statements are true.</p>
<p>And all of these are great reasons to pick Rust up for your next personal or professional project.</p>
<p>But in my mind, there's one reason everyone should consider trying out Rust:</p>
<p>Because its fun!</p>
<p>Seriously, Rust is my happy place.</p>
<p>Sure, like any language, it has its frustrations.</p>
<p>But when I work with Rust I <em>feel</em> smart</p>
<p>I have less horrible surprises than other languages I use professionally.</p>
<p>Amd I have a lot of confidence that my code will "just work", that I won't need to come back to fix bugs and if I do,
I'll be able to quickly understand old code, write new tests and fix any problems.</p>
<p>And, I'm not alone, since its 1.0 release Rust has been Stack Overflows "most loved" language eight years in a row.</p>
<p>This isn't just fanatics like me saying "its great" but is the percentage of people who used the language this year,
that still want to use it next year.</p>
<h3 id="why-not-rust"><a class="header" href="#why-not-rust">Why Not Rust</a></h3>
<p>Ok, but why <em>shouldn't</em> you learn Rust.</p>
<p>As much as I love Rust, there is a reason it may not be the language for you... and it's a <em>big</em> one.</p>
<p>If you are looking to learn a language to get a job (and you're not specifically interested in Blockchain) Rust is not
going to be a good language... for now.</p>
<p>That said, things have been slowly changing.</p>
<p>More businesses are picking it up due to its low cost to write, run and maintain.</p>
<p>The biggest cost for businesses looking to adopt Rust is training people, but there are more and more of us out
there and perhaps 2024 will finally be the tipping point.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, right now, if you're looking for a job, better languages to learn would be TypeScript or Python.</p>
<p>As well as being more marketable, these are genuinely great languages, and Rust will still be here when the time is
right for you.</p>
<h2 id="other-learning-resources"><a class="header" href="#other-learning-resources">Other Learning Resources</a></h2>
<p>My goal here is to get you into Rust, and if this series isn't for you, or if you want to supplement IRISS with other
resources, these are, in my mind, the (other) best ways to learn Rust</p>
<h3 id="the-official-book"><a class="header" href="#the-official-book">The Official Book</a></h3>
<p>The Rust Programming Language book, also known as "the living book" is where I started seven years ago, but, it's had
seven years of growth, and its amazing.</p>
<p>The main difference between the book and IRISS is that the book focuses on how the language works, while IRISS focuses
on how its written.</p>
<p>We will talk about how the language works but only in the context of why we write it the way that we do.</p>
<p>IRISS does, however, follow a similar path to both the official book and Rustlings (our next resource), so it should be
easy to jump between all three.</p>
<h3 id="rustlings"><a class="header" href="#rustlings">Rustlings</a></h3>
<p>Rustlings is a "learn by doing" guide to Rust. It works by giving you specific exercises to help you understand the
language a bit at a time.</p>
<p>The gamification of the course makes it really fun, and I still use Rustlings to help keep myself sharp.</p>
<p>There is also an IntelliJ Edu adaptation of Rustlings so if you install the free Community version of IntelliJ IDEA, you
can have an in editor tutorial.</p>
<h3 id="rust-by-example"><a class="header" href="#rust-by-example">Rust by Example</a></h3>
<p>Rust by Example does exactly what it says on the tin.</p>
<p>It focuses on the implementation of the Rust language.</p>
<p>This is great to quickly look things up if you know what you want to know, however, there's some minor
pseudo-anti-patterns here that if you don't already know are anti-patterns, you might accidentally copy.</p>
<p>Don't worry though, we'll cover these here but also tools like Clippy (which we'll also cover) will be quick to point
them out.</p>
<h3 id="idiomatic-rust-in-simple-steps"><a class="header" href="#idiomatic-rust-in-simple-steps">Idiomatic Rust in Simple Steps</a></h3>
<p>So, why use IRISS if there are these other great resources?</p>
<p>Idiomatic Rust in Simple Steps lines up nicely with these other resources and can supplement them or vice versa.</p>
<p>While the other resources focus on simply learning the language, IRISS focuses on how and why we write the language the
way we do.</p>
<p>This might seem like the same thing, but here we'll ramp up on idioms quickly so that you can understand other peoples
code as well as write code that other people can understand.</p>
<p>This matters!</p>
<p>My biggest hot take of the software industry is that: Software engineers are not paid to write code, we're paid to
solve problems.</p>
<p>The best engineers I've worked with have solved problems without writing a single line of code, and the cheapest code to
maintain is the code you didn't write.</p>
<p>Beyond this though, solving problems, even with code, takes understanding and collaboration. If when you join a team you
already understand why they write code the way they do, you're going to become productive much faster.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next"><a class="header" href="#whats-next">Whats Next</a></h2>
<p>In the next video we're going to cover, installing Rust, setting up your development environment and your first hello
world program.</p>
<p>I'm also going to teach you one neat trick that will super charge your learning and development skills!</p>
<p>If that's good bait, then I look forward to seeing you next time.</p>

<h2 id="preamble-1"><a class="header" href="#preamble-1">Preamble</a></h2>
<p>So, you want to learn the Rust programming language but where do you even start?</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you install it</li>
<li>How do you work with it</li>
<li>How do you write our first program</li>
<li>And whats going on inside</li>
</ul>
<p>Today we're gonna answer these questions.</p>
<p>This series has a free accompanying book, in which you can find all the details for this tutorial, check the
description below.</p>
<p>My name is Daniel, welcome to IRISS</p>
<h2 id="installing-rust"><a class="header" href="#installing-rust">Installing Rust</a></h2>
<p>How you install Rust depends on the operating system you're using.</p>
<p>I'm going to go over Mac and Linux first as they're both the same and quite simple.</p>
<p>Then I'll cover Windows which is a little bit different.</p>
<p>After that we'll go over setting up our development which is roughly the same for all systems, so use the video chapters
to skip to the parts of the video that are appropriate for you.</p>
<h3 id="mac-and-linux"><a class="header" href="#mac-and-linux">Mac and Linux</a></h3>
<p>Setting up Rust on Mac and Linux is exactly the same process... exactly the same, except for this one thing.</p>
<p>Before we begin, on Mac, you'll need to make sure you have xcode build tools.</p>
<p>Do that by opening up a terminal window and typing xcode dash select dash dash install</p>
<p>My Mac already has xcode's tools installed, if you don't have it, but this takes a good 20 minutes, so be patient and
come back when its done.</p>
<p>On Linux, you'll need to make sure you have gcc. Different flavours of Linux use different package managers, but if
you're using Linux as your daily driver, I'm hoping you already know how to use yours.</p>
<p>To demonstrate on Raspberry Pi, I'm going to type sudo apt install gcc, though you can see this Pi already has it
installed.</p>
<p>Everything else on these two systems is the same, so, next, head over to rustup dot rs and pop this in your console.</p>
<p>You'll be asked if you want to customize the install, I'm not going to so I'll choose 1 and press enter.</p>
<p>After a minute or two, the installation completes and it'll suggests sourcing the cargo env file.</p>
<p>You only need to do this if you want to use Rusts tools in the current terminal session, which we do, so lets do that</p>
<p>Now we can check that everything has installed correctly by running cargo version</p>
<p>And you should see something like this</p>
<p>Thats it, we're ready to go. Head on to the Development Environment chapter unless you're particularly curious about
the Windows install</p>
<h3 id="windows"><a class="header" href="#windows">Windows</a></h3>
<h4 id="build-tools"><a class="header" href="#build-tools">Build Tools</a></h4>
<p>Installing Rust on Windows is little bit more challenging but you've got this, I believe in you</p>
<p>First we're going to need Microsoft build tools. To get them we'll head to  visualstudio dot microsoft dot com slash
downloads and download the community edition</p>
<p>This installer is your gateway to a lot of stuff... almost none of which we actually need.</p>
<p>Click the tab for Individual components and search for the following</p>
<p>C++ x64 slash x86 build tools</p>
<p>Select the latest version</p>
<p>Next search for Windows SDK and choose the appropriate version for you.</p>
<p>I'm running Windows 11, so I'll choose the latest version of that SDK.</p>
<p>Then we'll click install and wait for it to do its thing. This can take a while so feel free to pause the video and
grab a cup of tea.</p>
<h4 id="rust-up"><a class="header" href="#rust-up">Rust up</a></h4>
<p>Now that we've got the build tools we can get the rust installer which we get from rustup dot rs</p>
<p>Download rustup-init.exe</p>
<p>When we run this we're given the option to customize the installation.</p>
<p>I'm not going to do that so I'll choose 1.</p>
<p>Once this is complete we can check that everything is working ok by opening a terminal (either cmd or powershell) and
running cargo version</p>
<p>And you should see something like this</p>
<h4 id="gcc"><a class="header" href="#gcc">GCC</a></h4>
<p>Ok, there's one more step that is... arguably optional and we (probably) won't need it for this series but as soon as
you step outside the series, you'll run into problems without it</p>
<p>You see Rust is a compiled language that can talk to and use other bits of compiled code</p>
<p>There are different ways to compile code and although at this point, you <em>can</em> compile anything we're going
to build in this series, you won't be able to compile everything that you could compile on Windows</p>
<p>For that we need GCC</p>
<p>The easiest way I've found to install GCC is via MSYS2</p>
<p>However, this... isn't great. If anyone knows of an easier way to get it, please please comment below.</p>
<p>=== New way ===</p>
<p>Hi, Daniel from the future here!</p>
<p>I found an easier way! While I'd previously tried package managers for this install step but wasn't happy with how you
install, and more importantly, uninstall the package managers themselves.</p>
<p>While researching a Database called SurrealDB I found another Windows package manager called Scoop, which is easier to
use. To get it, head over to their website and copy the installation steps into Powershell.</p>
<p>Once installed, we just type scoop install main/gcc</p>
<p>We can see that its installed properly straight after by typing gcc --version</p>
<p>Thats it, and we can skip a solid 5 minutes of unnecessary work!</p>
<p>Lets move on to Development Environments!</p>
<p>=== End new way ===</p>
<p>=== Old way ===</p>
<p>In the mean time, lets do this</p>
<p>First, we're going to grab the installer from msys2 dot org</p>
<p>and then run that</p>
<p>MSYS2 is a little bit fussy about where you install it so if in doubt just pop it where it wants to be</p>
<p>I'm going to install mine to the D drive in programs slash msys2</p>
<p>Wherever you put it, keep its location in mind, we'll have to find it again shortly</p>
<p>Once its installed, we need to make sure we have the ability to access any tools we install with it</p>
<p>We can do this by adding its binaries directory to the system path</p>
<p>This allows Windows to use anything installed there from anywhere else</p>
<p>First lets open the location where we installed it</p>
<p>Then open the ucrt64 directory, then bin</p>
<p>Copy the full address to the bin directory, you can do this by right clicking the address bar and clicking "Copy
Address"</p>
<p>Next we need to update the system path.</p>
<p>Go to your start menu and search for "environment", then click "Edit the system environment variables"</p>
<p>This, weirdly, doesn't take you straight to environment variables, but there is a button to do that at the bottom of
this screen.</p>
<p>Select Path, then hit edit</p>
<p>Click New on the right and paste in the address from earlier</p>
<p>Ok, last step</p>
<p>We're going to run the application MSYS2 UCRT64</p>
<p>And we'll run pacman dash capital S mingw dash w64 dash ucrt dash x86 underscore 64 dash gcc</p>
<p>You'll be asked for confirmation, just hit enter</p>
<p>This will install gcc and all of its dependencies</p>
<p>Once finished we can check this worked with gcc dash dash version</p>
<p>Phew, thats it, if you're still here, you are incredible!</p>
<p>The first time I tried this I honestly nearly cried</p>
<p>If you haven't done so already, its a good idea to restart your computer before moving on</p>
<p>Once you're back we'll set up a development environment</p>
<p>=== End Old Way ===</p>
<h2 id="the-development-environment"><a class="header" href="#the-development-environment">The Development Environment</a></h2>
<p>A software developers environment is something very specific to them. Some people love vim and neovim, others like Nova,
I'm personally a big fan of the IntelliJ ecosystem.</p>
<p>If you've already found the tools for you and they have good Rust support, there's no wrong answer here, use whatever
makes you happy.</p>
<p>If you're new to software engineering though, and not looking to fork out potentially hundreds on tooling, I recommend
Visual Studio Code.</p>
<p>It's free, it's perhaps the most widely used and supported editor today, and can be greatly extended through plugins.</p>
<p>It's the editor I'll be using throughout this series as I believe it will be the most familiar to people.</p>
<p>Lets go to code dot visualstudio dot com to download it</p>
<p>After installing it, we will need some plugins to work with Rust.</p>
<p>To get them, we'll start the app</p>
<p>Then click the extension button in the side bar</p>
<p>So... what do we need?</p>
<h3 id="rust-analyzer"><a class="header" href="#rust-analyzer">rust-analyzer</a></h3>
<p>First and perhaps most obviously, we need language support. Rust Analyzer will give us syntax highlighting, auto
complete, type hints, show documentation, allow symbol editing and will just generally make out lives a lot easier.</p>
<p>Lets grab that by clicking install</p>
<h3 id="codelldb"><a class="header" href="#codelldb">CodeLLDB</a></h3>
<p>This is the tool that's going to give us software engineering super powers</p>
<p>Sometimes you can be working on code and its not doing what you expect</p>
<p>"Happens to everyone all of the time, no need to worry"</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be cool to just step over each line of code as it runs and see exactly whats happening</p>
<p>LLDB will let us do that</p>
<p>We'll cover how it works in a bit, for now lets just grab it</p>
<h3 id="even-better-toml"><a class="header" href="#even-better-toml">Even Better TOML</a></h3>
<p>The Rust ecosystem makes heavy use of the TOML file format</p>
<p>We'll talk about this more later in the series but now is a good time to pick up this extension</p>
<h3 id="crates"><a class="header" href="#crates">crates</a></h3>
<p>Finally, Rust developers share code through a mechanism called Crates</p>
<p>The crates extension will help us keep any crates we're using up to date</p>
<p>Again, we're not going to dive into this just yet but we should get it now while we're here</p>
<h2 id="hello-world"><a class="header" href="#hello-world">Hello World</a></h2>
<p>With all of that out of the way, we are <em>finally</em> ready to create our first program</p>
<p>After all you've achieved already, you're not going to believe how easy the next bit is</p>
<p>The first program most developers write in a new language is called Hello World</p>
<p>All it does is that when you run it, it will, in some way, output Hello World, so lets do that</p>
<p>Lets open up a terminal and navigate somewhere we want to work</p>
<p>So, for example, on Mac or Linux, I might make a directory in my home folder</p>
<p>On Windows I might navigate to My Documents and make a directory there</p>
<p>Now we'll use cargo, remember cargo, from what seems like forever ago, to make our new project</p>
<p>cargo new hello hyphen world</p>
<p>Now we can open the project in visual studio code by typing code hello hyphen world</p>
<p>As you can see, cargo has created a few files for us</p>
<p>A .gitignore file which is useful for version control</p>
<p>Version Control Systems are out of scope of this series but I highly recommend looking into a system called Git</p>
<p>This will let you save your work in incremental steps as well as being an industry standard method of sharing and
collaboration</p>
<p>Cargo.toml describes the project as a whole, what dependencies it uses and any special preparations or settings it needs</p>
<p>We'll come back to this file in the future but for now we won't be using it</p>
<p>Finally we have our source directory in which all of our Rust code will live</p>
<p>The name of the file main.rs is used to tell Rust that we're going to make an executable program</p>
<p>Inside we'll see we can already see some code</p>
<p>Before I go through it all, lets run the program</p>
<p>For now we can do this from the terminal which we can access inside Code</p>
<p>Pro Tip for new Visual Studio Code users, if you want to do something and aren't sure how, you can hold Control (or
Command on Macs) Shift and hit P</p>
<p>This brings up a little search bar you can use to find what you want in this case a terminal</p>
<p>Sometimes you might have to scroll a little to find the exact right thing but recently used things will filter to the
top so we don't have to do this too often</p>
<p>The terminal should open in our projects directory so all we have to do now is type cargo run</p>
<p>We get some output that its compiled and then we get our Hello World written to the screen!</p>
<p>Well that was easy. Our first rust program which we've arguably built ourselves without writing a single line of code
manually</p>
<p>You'll find that the Rust community has put a lot of effort into making Rust as easy as possible to learn an use</p>
<h3 id="anatomy-of-hello-world"><a class="header" href="#anatomy-of-hello-world">Anatomy of Hello World</a></h3>
<p>Looking at our main.rs lets break it down line by line</p>
<p>First we have this <code>fn main() {</code></p>
<p>In Rust, fn is how we describe a function and a function is basically just a little chunk of code</p>
<p>We'll talk more about functions in a future video</p>
<p>The next bit "main" is the name of the funciton</p>
<p>We can usually call functions anything we like but when we create an executable program, one that can be run on its own,
we need a function called "main" to be the start point</p>
<p>The parentheses after the name of the function is where we normally put parameters</p>
<p>Parameters are how we pass data into a function, but we don't pass data into the main function so this is empty</p>
<p>The curly bracket that opens on this line has a matching closing curly bracket that denotes where the function ends,
everything inside is part of the function</p>
<p>Inside the function we have one line but lets break it into parts</p>
<p>First, the println (or print line) with an exclamation mark might look a bit like another function however, when you see
a label like print line followed by an exclamation mark its actually something called a macro.</p>
<p>Creating macros is a very advanced topic and we won't cover that until near the end of this series, however, they are
incredibly powerful and we will be using them a lot.</p>
<p>For now, don't worry about it, all you need to know is that they can do a lot more than functions and often don't
behave anything like functions</p>
<p>We still have parentheses delimiting the start and end of what we're passing to the macro, but in this case you <em>could</em>
also use square brackets or curly brackets, but for print line parentheses are the convention</p>
<p>Inside the print line we have a sequence of characters, surrounded by double quotes. This is, generally called a string.
Rust actually has lots of different kinds of strings, and we'll go into them more in the next video.</p>
<p>Feel free to change this to change the message being printed out.</p>
<h2 id="running-and-debugging"><a class="header" href="#running-and-debugging">Running and Debugging</a></h2>
<p>Before we end this video, I believe I promised you all some super powers</p>
<p>First lets make a quick change</p>
<p>Lets add our name into a variable.</p>
<p>I'll be talking more about variables in a couple of videos time, but quickly, we declare a variable with let, give it a
name put an equals sign after and then the value</p>
<p>String values like this need to be delimited with double quotes in Rust</p>
<p>Quite nicely this reads as let name equal Daniel</p>
<p>Another quick note: if your name does not use American English characters, this type of string in Rust is UTF-8 by
default and your name should be fine, however, your operating system might not be so when it writes it our, your milage
may vary.</p>
<p>For example, my Mac is fine with my cats name, Yuki, but Windows, not so much</p>
<p>Anyway, we're going to modify our print line now to include the variable</p>
<p>There are a number of ways we can achieve this but the idiomatic way to do this is to use curly brackets and put the
variable name inside</p>
<p>Before we run our program again, if you mouse over the line number on line 3, you should see a little red dot appear,
click it</p>
<p>This is whats called a break point</p>
<p>Next we're going to run our program inside Code by pressing F5 and... uh oh... error message</p>
<p>Don't panic, this is just because we didn't tell Code how to run the program, luckily it can work it out for us</p>
<p>This varies a little bit on Mac and Windows but we're just going to tell it to run the program with LLDB</p>
<p>Now when we press F5 again, the program compiles and starts running but look! It stopped at the break point</p>
<p>We can now hover over the variable and see not only whats inside but how its stored</p>
<p>Having the ability to do this is incredible when trying to debug things or understand how something works</p>
<h2 id="next-time"><a class="header" href="#next-time">Next Time</a></h2>
<p>And that's it for today! It was a longer one today but honestly, just getting started might be the hardest part of the
whole series, but you did it and that's awesome, I'm legitimately proud of you</p>
<p>Next time we're going to make a slightly more advanced program by taking a bit of input and doing some comparisons</p>
<p>This way we can get a better feel for how Rust looks and feels.</p>
<p>If thats interesting to you, don't forget to like and subscribe</p>
<p>In the meantime, seriously, well done, take some time to reflect on your achievement,</p>
<p>You're now an official Rustacean</p>
<p>And I'll see you next time!</p>

<p>When you create a program, how does it remember things? Last time, we created a variable and put our name
inside it. Where was our name stored?</p>
<p>Jumping into memory already might seem unusual.</p>
<p>A lot of programming tutorials in any language would like to get you writing code before you have to worry about such
things.</p>
<p>However, I think right off the bat we have a wonderful opportunity to talk about how memory works in Rust and, because
memory is so important to how Rust works, learning this will simplify everything else going forward.</p>
<p>Today, we're going to make an extremely simple program and use that as the basis to explain how Rust remembers.</p>
<p>This series has a free accompanying book, in which you can find all the details for this tutorial, check the
description below.</p>
<p>My name is Daniel, welcome to IRISS</p>
<h2 id="the-guessing-game"><a class="header" href="#the-guessing-game">The Guessing Game</a></h2>
<p>To learn about memory, we'll make a simplified version of the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html">guessing game</a>
from the official Rust book. Start by opening your terminal and navigating to where-ever your creating you projects,
just like last time, then we'll create a new project with:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">cargo new guessing-game
</code></pre>
<p>Then we'll open the project go to the file <code>src/main.rs</code>. As before we'll see the same "hello, world" program:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Let's quickly change our hello world message to something that welcomes us to the game.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    println!("Welcome to the guessing game!");
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>And add another print line that tells the user what to expect</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">    println!("Welcome to the guessing game!");
</span>    println!("I have chosen a color red, green or blue, can you guess which?");
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Let's pick a color that the user has to guess, I'm going to pick "blue" but feel free to pick your favourite</p>
<p>Before we move on, I want to talk about the "type" of the data we've just created.</p>
<p>We're going to cover types properly in the next video, but I want to quickly point some things out.</p>
<p>The type of data describes a number of things but mainly, how that data is represented in memory and how it can be used.</p>
<p>For example, is the data a string (like "blue"), or a number, or a boolean that represent true or false.</p>
<p>As you can see, my editor has written colon ampersand str after actual. This isn't part of the text, it's just there to
show me the "type" of the variable.</p>
<p>This means that the variable <code>actual</code> contains a "reference" (represented by the <code>&amp;</code>) to a "string slice" (represented
by <code>str</code>). We'll talk about why the variable only contains a reference and not the data itself later. You could, if you
like, manually write this yourself, however, it's generally better to let Rust infer the
type, and only write it yourself if either Rust is unable to decide (because it could be multiple things) or in the case
that Rust has a default type, you want to use something different.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to the program: let's output the color so that we can see the program is working ok</p>
<p>Great... but not much of a game is it, you don't even have time to guess before you're told what it is.</p>
<p>Before we tell the user what the actual color was lets ask them to guess.</p>
<p>In order to get some user input, we need to read from the terminal.</p>
<p>When the program runs in the terminal, we can ask the user to type things.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you are on Windows, Mac or Linux, this input is passed into the program through a stream of data
called standard in.</p>
<p>Rust comes with a "standard library", the name is unrelated to the stream, they both just happen to be "standard"</p>
<p>We can access the standard library as a module called <code>std</code>. I pronounce this S T D, but I think most people say "stud"
and I should really start doing that.</p>
<p>Modules in Rust are a way of grouping up other bits of code such as functions, data types and even other modules.</p>
<p>We'll talk about them more in a future video.</p>
<p>Inside of this is another module called <code>io</code> that deals with input and output.</p>
<p>If we weren't using the <code>println!</code> macro, this is where we'd have to come to write things out to the terminal too, via
a stream called <code>stdout</code> (standard out). <code>println!</code> is a nice little wrapper that makes writing to stdout pretty
trivial.</p>
<p>For completion's sake I should mention that, in addition to standard in and standard out, there is one more stream
called standard error. This is also an output stream that we can use to separate informational output that is not
part of the normal use of the program, whether that be errors or just information not directly relevant to the main
output.</p>
<p><code>stderr</code> is really useful for things like logging, which we'll talk about in the future, but if you want to quickly
write something to this stream you can use <code>eprintln!</code> and <code>eprint!</code> the same way we use <code>println!</code> and <code>print!</code></p>
<p>So, we get stdin using <code>std::io::stdin()</code>, this is a function call (we'll talk about functions in a couple of videos),
that returns something called a "handle" that we can use for temporary access to the input stream.</p>
<p>The double colons just tell Rust that we're looking for something inside a module. We'll cover modules in detail later,
including how, why and when to make our own, as well as better ways to access them, but since we only need to write
this line once, this is the easiest way to do it.</p>
<p>We could store the result of <code>stdin()</code> in a variable, however, we only use this handle once, and then we're done with
it.</p>
<p>So, off the back of the function call, we can call immediately call <code>.lines()</code>.</p>
<p>This is a method (a special type of function that belongs specifically to some other thing, in this case it belongs to
the handle for stdin).</p>
<p><code>.lines()</code> returns an iterator, allowing us to iterate (or step through) each line one at a time. We get the next line
by calling <code>.next()</code> on the iterator.</p>
<p>Wait wait wait, what are those <code>expect</code>s about?!</p>
<p><code>expect()</code> is, I would say, the second-worst way you could handle something going wrong in your program.</p>
<p>This is not "idiomatic" and you absolutely should not use this in anything except the most throw away software as it
will immediately cause the program to stop and spew a lot of information at the user.</p>
<p>In the future we'll talk about things going wrong and how to better handle them, however, as this program is just for
you, I think you'll cope for now. 😊</p>
<p>That doesn't explain what these lines are doing, or why there are two of them though. The reason for this is that there
are two possible ways <code>.lines()</code> might not work.</p>
<p>The first expect then:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">.expect("No input was read")</code></pre>
<p>When we call <code>.next()</code> on any iterator, there either is something next or there isn't. In some languages this concept of
something or nothing might be represented as either the data you wanted or <code>null</code>.</p>
<p>For example, in another language we might ask for a string and get <code>"red"</code> or <code>null</code>.</p>
<p>"red" is a string but null is not... what happens if you try to use the returned value as if it was a string?</p>
<p>In languages with this behaviour might produce and error at the point where the data is used, not where it was
generated, so you have to make sure to always check that your data is what it's supposed to be, which, the language
isn't making an effort to remind you to do.</p>
<p>Obviously many people think this ambiguity is bad, including Tony Hoare, arguably the "inventor" of this  behavior, who
has called it his "billion-dollar mistake".</p>
<p>Rust does not allow you to use types like this interchangeably, so data can not be a string or null as these types are
not compatible.</p>
<p>In Rust, we use a kind of container type to get around this called <code>Option</code>.</p>
<p>Option is an enum meaning its value is one of a set number of variants, in this case the variant is either Some or None</p>
<p>If the variant of the Option is Some then it contains our value, otherwise it does not.</p>
<p>Importantly, when a function returns an <code>Option</code> type you, the programmer, must check to see if it contains
Some data and then extract the data if it's there.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways to do this and <code>.expect</code> is one of the worst ways to do this. It will attempt to extract the
data if its there, or stop the program abruptly with the provided error message if it's not.</p>
<p>We'll talk about better ways to handle this in the future.</p>
<p>For the time being we're going to just say we can't deal with it not being there, we don't want to continue running the
program, and we want the program to stop.</p>
<p>We use <code>.expect("message")</code> to say, if this is nothing, we are giving up, stop the program and print our message
(plus a few other useful bits) to the <code>stderr</code>.</p>
<p>You can see why this behaviour is typically undesirable but, we can allow it for this example, at least until we
learn how to deal with <code>Option</code> properly.</p>
<p>The second expect is a bit different:</p>
<p>If the Option we got from <code>.next()</code> contains something instead of nothing, it <em>still</em> doesn't necessarily mean we read
the users input correctly, reading data from standard in is itself fallible.</p>
<p>Fallibility, the nature that something may go wrong, in programming is another thing we've traditionally handled very
badly.</p>
<p>A common way to deal with this in other languages is to stop executing and "throw" an error.</p>
<p>The problem with throwing errors is that it breaks the flow of execution.</p>
<p>Normally code is executed one line after another but once an error is thrown, the next thing to get executed after the
throw is not obvious, it's going to be wherever the error is "caught"... if it's "caught".</p>
<p>Sometimes you may not even realise that some code you've written could throw an error because you've called someone
else's code, and they didn't make it obvious that their code could fail.</p>
<p>Rust does away with this with another enum type called <code>Result</code>.</p>
<p>If your function can fail, it must return a Result type.</p>
<p>Like with <code>Option</code>, <code>Result</code> is its own type that contains either the data we wanted, or an error.</p>
<p>The idiomatic way to handle Result types depends on what you're trying to do; could you recover from an error and keep
the program running, how do we want to report the error back to the user, etc.</p>
<p>Using <code>expect</code> will, again, cause the program to immediately stop with the error message sent to standard error, and
again, you can see why this is typically extremely undesirable.</p>
<p>For now, we'll make do with the two expects, and we have a working program.</p>
<p>There is an actual color, the user guesses a color, and we print both to the screen.</p>
<h2 id="memory"><a class="header" href="#memory">Memory</a></h2>
<p>To the meat of our today's video then.</p>
<p>You might have spotted that <code>actual</code> and <code>input</code> have different types</p>
<p>Don't worry if you didn't, when we added all the code associated with getting the input, it added a lot of types, so
you could easily miss it.</p>
<p>Importantly though, <code>actual</code> is a reference to a string slice, however, <code>input</code> is a capital S <code>String</code>.</p>
<p>What's the difference?</p>
<p>To understand this, we have to talk a little bit about how our program runs.</p>
<h3 id="the-stack"><a class="header" href="#the-stack">The Stack</a></h3>
<p>In Rust (and many languages in fact), programs are made up of functions; small, independent bits of code. In our
program we only have one function for now, which is <code>main</code>, but this next bit still applies.</p>
<p>When we run our program, the operating system assigns some memory for the program to run in, called "the stack".</p>
<p>Functions can call other functions and each time we go into a new function we create a new block of memory on the stack
that's the exact size of everything that function needs to remember.</p>
<p>For example, imagine the following program with the functions main, f1 and f2.</p>
<p>When the program is initialized the operating system assigns some memory for the stack, then, all the memory required to
store all the variables in <code>main</code> (which in this example is 4 addresses) is blocked off.</p>
<p>Then, as <code>main</code> runs, it calls the <code>f1</code> function which requires two more addresses. A new block with space for those
variables is put on top of the stack</p>
<p><code>f1</code> then calls another function, <code>f2</code>, which requires 3 addresses worth of memory which create another block on the
top of the stack.</p>
<p>Once <code>f2</code> has finished, it is removed from the stack, then <code>f1</code> finishes, and it too is removed from the stack. Finally
<code>main</code> comes to an end and our program closes and all memory is freed.</p>
<p>You can see that the amount of memory a function needs is very important, but... how long is a piece of string? <em>shake</em>
How much space does a string take in memory?</p>
<p>Our three colors, "red", "blue" and "green" are 3 characters, 4 characters and 5 characters respectively.</p>
<p>How much memory should we assign on the stack? What about the users input?</p>
<p>Is that 3 characters, 4 characters or the complete works of Shakespeare?</p>
<p>How much memory each function will require is decided at build time, and we don't know what the user is going to write
until later.</p>
<p>Anything that lives inside a variable goes on the stack, and anything on the stack must be of known size when the
program is compiled.</p>
<p>In Rust, we have a specific name for this "Sized". Things like numbers, characters, and booleans are Sized, but a
string of characters is not, it is "Unsized".</p>
<p>So where does our data live if not inside the variables?</p>
<p>Returning to the top, you'll remember that our <code>actual</code> variable has the type <code>&amp;str</code>. The ampersand tells us the value
is a reference, and the "str" tells us that it's a reference to a string slice.</p>
<p>A reference is something that points to where some actual data is,</p>
<p>this is very handy when you want to tell something about some data without having to give it the actual data.</p>
<p>When you manually write a string between double quotes <code>"like this"</code>, it's called a "string literal".</p>
<p>This applies to our variable as well as every time we've used in a <code>println!</code>.</p>
<p>String literals are hard coded into the binary file that we create when we compile the program (in our case, that's the
executable file that gets run)</p>
<p>A "string slice" can be any part of a string stored somewhere else, so it can be characters 0 to 3 (b, l, u, e) of our
string literal wherever it is in the executable file.</p>
<h3 id="the-heap"><a class="header" href="#the-heap">The Heap</a></h3>
<p>Our <code>input</code>, however, is very different, we don't know what's going to be in here at all at compile time.</p>
<p>In order to store the data that the user gives us, we still need to put it in memory somewhere, but it can't live on the
stack on in the binary.</p>
<p>Instead, we use another kind of memory called "the Heap".</p>
<p>At any point while the program is running, we can ask the operating system to allow us to access some amount of memory.</p>
<p>We still need to know how much memory we need, but now we only need to know how much memory at runtime.</p>
<p>This memory comes from the Heap.</p>
<p>In the heap, we can store "Unsized" data (as well as Sized which can be useful under certain circumstances) and, then
because everything about the location of that data is Sized, we can store it in a variable on the stack.</p>
<p><code>String</code> does not contain the data, but does know where the data is.</p>
<p>Some other important differences between the Stack and the Heap.</p>
<p>The Stack is more limited in size, you should try to avoid storing large amounts of data here</p>
<p>Creating memory on the Heap takes longer than creating it on the Stack, this is because you have to communicate your
requirements to the operating system and wait for it to get back to you with that allocation.</p>
<p>This doesn't take so long that you're going to notice... unless you do it a lot.</p>
<p>This is all great, but why is one of them <code>&amp;str</code> and one of them <code>String</code> if both of them are just references to data
stored elsewhere?</p>
<p>This actually comes down to "ownership". We'll go into ownership in more detail later in a later chapter but at a very
high level a reference to a string slice does not own the string data.</p>
<p>Whereas a capital S string owns, and therefore has full control over the data.</p>
<p>Most importantly, ownership tells the program when to clean up the data.</p>
<p>When an <code>&amp;str</code> is no longer needed, the reference is cleaned up, but the data still exists.</p>
<p>When a <code>String</code> is no longer needed, not only is the reference cleaned up, but memory where the string data was sored is
also returned to the operating systems control, freeing it up for something else to use.</p>
<p>It's important to note though that <code>&amp;str</code> and <code>String</code> are different types.</p>
<p>The data they reference is formatted the same way in memory, but they are not interchangeable.</p>
<p>Later, when we discuss functions, you'll see that if a function requires a <code>String</code> you can not pass it a <code>&amp;str</code> and
vice versa.</p>
<p>However, you can trivially convert between them</p>
<p>For example, we could turn our <code>actual</code> variable into a String by creating a new String from that data.</p>
<p>And we can get a reference to a string slice from inside the string.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let name = "Daniel";                   // This is a &amp;str pointing at a sequence of bytes in the executable
let name_on_heap = String::from(name); // This requests memory from the operating system then copies "Daniel" into it
let name_ref = name_on_heap.as_str();  // This is a &amp;str pointing to a sequence of bytes on the heap
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Despite the type difference between actual and input, they can be compared to each other.</p>
<p>In fact, Rust lets you compare any two types so long as someone has told Rust how to do the comparison, which, for
Strings and sting slices, someone has.</p>
<p>Let's return to our program one last time, and we'll add a branch to our code.</p>
<p><code>if</code>/<code>else</code> is a form of flow control that allows us to do one thing if the expression we put in the "if" evaluates to
true, and something else if it doesn't.</p>
<p>So "if" input is equal to actual, we'll print "you win", else, we'll print "you lose"</p>
<h2 id="to-review"><a class="header" href="#to-review">To Review:</a></h2>
<p>Today we learned specifically about the Stack and Heap:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Stack is where variables live, data must be of known size at compile time (Sized), but access is very fast.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Heap is where we can store things regardless of whether we know their size at compile time (Sized and Unsized).
We can store large amounts of data here but getting access to this memory initially is a tiny be slower.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can reference data if you don't want ownership of the data, but you do want to access it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We also learned a bit about <code>Option</code> and <code>Result</code> which we will go into more in the next video, and future videos
too.</p>
<p>Finally, we touched on controlling the flow of execution with <code>if</code>, however, this isn't the only way we can effect
the flow, and we'll talk more about this in a couple of videos.</p>
<h2 id="bonus"><a class="header" href="#bonus">Bonus</a></h2>
<p>This has nothing to do with today's topic, and I'm not going to go deep on anything but... I couldn't leave you with a
guessing game that isn't really a game.</p>
<p>If we want to randomise the "actual" value we can create an array of all possible values.</p>
<p>An Array is a list of things of the same type, seperated by commas and surrounded with square brackets.</p>
<p>Arrays are Sized, but they can not have their size changed at runtime (there are other types for that).</p>
<p>We can then fake randomness by getting a big number that will change every time we run the program... like the time.</p>
<p>The unix epoch was midnight on the first of January 1970, we can find out how much time has passed since then and then
get that time in milliseconds.</p>
<p>We need to do a quick type conversion, which we'll talk about next time, this just lets us use the number of
milliseconds to access the array. This conversion is could truncate the data, but it doesn't matter in this case.</p>
<p>Finally, we can find the remainder after dividing by the length of the array by using the remainder operator</p>
<p>This gives us a random(ish) index into the array.</p>
<p>Now when you run the program, you won't know what the actual color is!</p>

<h2 id="preamble-3"><a class="header" href="#preamble-3">Preamble</a></h2>
<p>We lightly covered types in the last video, but only really to show the importance of where things live in memory.</p>
<p>Rust's types system is perhaps one of its most rigorous and powerful features, understanding it is key to
understanding why the language is the way it is.</p>
<p>Today we'll cover the basic Types (also known as Primitive Types) that exist within Rust,
and what structures we can use to create our own, more complex types (also known as Compound types).</p>
<p>This series has a free accompanying book, in which you can find all the details for this tutorial, check the
description below.</p>
<p>My name is Daniel, welcome to IRISS.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-type"><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-type">What is a Type</a></h2>
<p>In programming a Type describes what kind of data or values can be used in a particular circumstance</p>
<p>In Rust, we use Types to describe variables, parameters, properties or anywhere else you can have a value, so that the
compiler knows what the data at that point will look like inside the running program, and how it will behave.</p>
<p>This can include where in memory the data lives, how it's represented in memory, and what functionality can be assigned
to the data (though we'll cover that last part in a few videos time).</p>
<h2 id="primitive-types"><a class="header" href="#primitive-types">Primitive Types</a></h2>
<p>Primitive types are effectively the building blocks of all other types.</p>
<p>I think this is an early point in learning Rust that scares off a lot of potential new Rust engineers. You see, Rust has
a <em>lot</em> of primitive types.</p>
<p>I'm going to show this to you now, but I don't want you to worry about it.</p>
<p>You, whoever you are my dear rustacean, have already achieved things more complicated than learning this, don't panic</p>
<p>So, are you ready to see something terrifying that long before the end of the video you're going to have a complete
handle on?</p>
<p>Here we go (((Show chart)))</p>
<p>This is how many primitive types there are in Rust! And yes, as scary as it is, you will completely understand this in
just a few minutes!</p>
<p>First and most importantly, forget this chart for now, there's really only five categories that we actually care about
(((Show chart)))</p>
<p>integers, floating points, characters, booleans and string slices</p>
<p>We'll go over each of these individually, explain how they work, their variations and what you might use them for.</p>
<p>Before we do, in order to understand those variations, lets very quickly cover binary.</p>
<h3 id="binary-primer"><a class="header" href="#binary-primer">Binary Primer</a></h3>
<p>Don't panic! No one is expecting you to learn to count in binary. Counting in binary is fun, but pretty useless.</p>
<p>All I want to do is show you how things are represented in memory because it's going to make all those Rust types make a
lot of sense!</p>
<p>Humans (mostly) count in base 10. That's numbers going from 0 to 9. You can imagine numbers as a series of columns,
where each column represents how many 1s, 10s, 100s, etc. there are in the number.</p>
<p>For example, the number one hundred and twenty-three contains one lot of 100, two lots of 10, and three lots of 1</p>
<p>When we add numbers to the columns, if the column goes over 9, then we add to the next column along.</p>
<p>So, if we add 1 to 9, it goes to 10, 19 goes to 20, and 99 goes to 100 (because the roll-over from the right most 9 adds
to the next 9 also causing it to roll over).</p>
<p>This counting system is called base 10 as each of those columns is 10 raised to the power of which column it is,
starting at 0:</p>
<ul>
<li>ten to the power of zero is one</li>
<li>ten to the power of one is ten</li>
<li>ten to the power of two is a hundred</li>
<li>ten to the power of three is a thousand</li>
<li>etcetera</li>
</ul>
<p>Electronics, and by extension computers, can only really cope reliably with things that are <code>on</code> or <code>off</code> though.</p>
<p>How do you count with only on or off? Well, what if instead of having ten possible values in each column (0-9 or base
10), we only have two (0-1 or base 2). This is binary.</p>
<p>In binary our columns are a bit different:</p>
<ul>
<li>two to the power of zero is still one but</li>
<li>two to the power of one is two</li>
<li>two to the power of two is four</li>
<li>two to the power of three is eight</li>
<li>etcetera</li>
</ul>
<p>So if we want to represent the number 13 in base 2, we can see it contains one 8, one 4, and one 1 (8 + 4 + 1 = 13).</p>
<p>If we mark those columns as one's and the others as zeros we get one one zero one</p>
<p>Sometimes when we want to write something in binary and be explicit that that is the system we're using we might write:
oh B one one oh one.</p>
<p>The oh B at the start makes it clear that a number like ob B one one oh one represents "thirteen" and not "one thousand
one hundred and one".</p>
<p>Each 1 or 0 is a <em><strong>b</strong></em>inary dig<em><strong>it</strong></em>, which is where we get the term "bit".</p>
<p>Eight bits is a byte, and can represent the numbers from zero to two hundred and fifty-five, again, I'm not expecting
anyone to be able to <em>read</em> this.</p>
<p>The reason why a byte is eight bits has a lot of history, but it basically comes down to character encoding: with 7
bits, you can represent 127 characters which covers english lowercase, uppercase, numbers 0-9, various whitespace and
punctuation, and still have 1 bit left over for simple error checking.</p>
<p>As a quick aside, as a software engineer, you're very likely to also see numbers written in hexadecimal (base 16).</p>
<p>This is because hexadecimal, is really nice when working with bytes. One byte (8 bits) perfectly maps to two
hexadecimal digits.</p>
<p>Hexadecimal digits go from 0 to 15, but are represented as zero to F (ie: zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, A, B, C, D, E, F).</p>
<p>oh X F is 15, and so is oh B one one one one. The number two hundred and fifty-five is much easier to write as oh X F F
than oh B one one one one - one one one one.</p>
<p>Both the oh B and oh X notation work in Rust if you want to write numbers as binary or hexadecimal respectively. You can
also use underscores to space numbers for legibility.</p>
<h3 id="integers"><a class="header" href="#integers">Integers</a></h3>
<p>Now that you've had that primer on binary, I bet those twelve different integer types are starting to make a lot more
sense!</p>
<p>The most basic number type in Rust is the <code>u8</code>.</p>
<p>This is an <em>unsigned</em> integer (represented by the <code>u</code>) that is 8 bits in length.</p>
<p>Unsigned means that the number can only be positive (it does not have a negative sign).</p>
<p>You might have already guessed, but this is one byte, and can hold the numbers 0 to two hundred and fifty-five.</p>
<p>A byte like this can be used for all sorts of things, though one common example is as part of a color.</p>
<p>We often represent colors as 8 bits of red, 8 bits of green, 8 bits of blue and sometimes 8 bits of transparency.</p>
<p><code>i8</code> is an integer that can represent both positive and negative numbers (i.e. it's signed).</p>
<p>It also only uses 8 bits of data but instead of going from 0 to two hundred and fifty-five, it goes from negative
one hundred and twenty-eight to positive one hundred and twenty-seven.</p>
<p>You never need to know this, <em>but</em>, if you're interested in the mathematics of how it does this, it uses a method called
two's complement.</p>
<p>Two's complement, however, is complicated, and we don't think like computers.</p>
<p>The easiest way to visualise it is the left most column is the negative version of itself, and all other numbers are the
same.</p>
<p>So, the number negative one hundred and twenty-five can be represented as one zero zero zero - zero zero one one.
((Show table))</p>
<p>ie, the number contains one lot of negative one hundred and twenty-eight, one positive two and one positive one.</p>
<p>Negative one hundred and twenty-eight, plus two, plus one gives us negative one hundred and twenty-five.</p>
<p>So that's <code>u8</code> and <code>i8</code>, and now you've probably guessed that for all the other integer types;</p>
<ul>
<li><code>u</code> means it can only be positive</li>
<li><code>i</code> means it can be positive or negative</li>
<li>the number after is how many bits are available to the number</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we can build up a little table to show the minimum and maximum of these types:
((Show table))</p>
<hr />
<p>Wow, those numbers get big fast!</p>
<p>There's still two types missing though; <code>usize</code> and <code>isize</code>.</p>
<p>In this case, the <code>size</code> is also acting as the number of bits, however, unlike the other integer types, the size of
<code>size</code> is variable.</p>
<p>Rust is a compiled language, meaning that the code you write in Rust is transformed into instructions that a CPU can
understand.</p>
<p>CPUs are all different, but they typically follow some given "architecture".</p>
<p>For example, if you're watching this on a Windows or Linux desktop, the architecture of your CPU is <em>probably</em> <code>x86_64</code>.</p>
<p>If you're watching this on a Mac or a mobile phone, then the architecture is <em>probably</em> <code>arm64</code>.</p>
<p>When you compile Rust it will compile into an instruction set for the architecture your machine uses, though you can
also tell it what instruction set to compile for, if you want to build it on one architecture but run it on another.</p>
<p><code>x86_64</code> and <code>arm64</code> are both 64bit architectures, so when you build for these machines, the <code>size</code> in <code>usize</code> and
<code>isize</code> becomes <code>64</code>.</p>
<p>However, if you were to compile for, say, a Cortex M zero microprocessor, then the instruction set would likely be <code>Thumb-1</code>
which is 16bit so the <code>size</code> in <code>usize</code> and <code>isize</code> becomes <code>16</code>.</p>
<h4 id="which-integer-is-right-for-you"><a class="header" href="#which-integer-is-right-for-you">Which integer is right for you?</a></h4>
<p>You might think the obvious thing to do would be to use the largest possible integer types.</p>
<p>For example, you can fit pretty much every whole number you could possibly need into <code>i128</code>, so why use anything else?</p>
<p>There's two things to think about, first, what is the intended use of the number and, second, what is the architecture
of the machine you're running on?</p>
<p>In software engineering, a number is never just a number, it represents something.</p>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, colors are often (but not always), represented as 0 to 255 for each of red, green and blue.</p>
<p>This means that a <code>u8</code> is the best way to store these.</p>
<p>If you combine those three colors with another 8 bits for transparency, then you have four lots of <code>u8</code> which
can be represented as a <code>u32</code>.</p>
<p><code>u8</code> is also a good size for representing a stream of unicode characters, which is where we get <code>UTF-8</code>, the default
encoding for Rust strings.</p>
<p>For larger, more arbitrary, numbers though, you still may not want to use the largest integer types.</p>
<p>While you can use integers that are wider than the architecture that you're running your program on, like using a
<code>i128</code> on a 64 bit machine, mathematics with those numbers will be slower.</p>
<p>The CPU can only process so many bits at once, so when it has numbers larger than that, it has to do multiple rounds of
processing to achieve the same results as it might have done if those numbers were stored in smaller integers.</p>
<p>You might then think that the best thing to do is use a <code>usize</code> or <code>isize</code> if you don't really care about how big a
number can get, and that's fine, and I often do this, but now you have to bear in mind that the behaviour of your
program may no longer be consistent on different machines!</p>
<p>A <code>usize</code> on a Mac is going to be cap out at over eighteen quintillion, but on a Cortex M zero it's a mere thirty-two
thousand!</p>
<p>By default, when you write an integer and store it in a variable, Rust will play it safe and use an <code>i32</code> as it doesn't
know what you might want to do with the number.</p>
<p>An <code>i32</code> will fit inside most CPU architectures without needing extra work and allows negative numbers.</p>
<p>However, it is more idiomatic to be intentional about the types you use.</p>
<p>My methodology here is roughly:</p>
<ul>
<li>does this number represent something of a specific size like a color or ascii character, in which case, use that size</li>
<li>is this number going to be used to access an array, in which case it really ought to be a <code>usize</code></li>
<li>do I need something huge, computational cost be damned, then <code>u128</code> or <code>i128</code> is the way to go</li>
<li>am I more concerned with speed than consistency, in which case <code>usize</code> or <code>isize</code></li>
<li>otherwise 32 or 64bit integers are probably fine, especially if I know what my code will run on</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>You can specify what type a number is either by annotating the variable you are putting it inside</p>
<p>Or, if that's not possible because you are, for example, passing the number straight to a function that could take many
number types, you can write the type at the end of a number</p>
<hr />
<p>A brief note on Type Conversion: You can convert between integer types in several ways, which we'll talk about more
later, but I wanted to quickly go over some code from the last video.</p>
<p>In the bonus section of the last video, we got the number of milliseconds that had passed since midnight on the 1st
of January 1970, and then immediately used <code>as usize</code>:
((Show code))</p>
<p>The reason for this is the number of milliseconds since that date is approximately one trillion, seven hundred billion
and is returned as a <code>u128</code>.</p>
<p>We wanted to use this as part of a calculation to work out an index into an array and indexes in arrays are always
<code>usize</code>.</p>
<p>If you were to compile this program on a 32bit architecture, then the number of milliseconds
is greater than what would fit into a <code>usize</code> which would be just over four billion.</p>
<p>When we use <code>as</code> it simply takes the number, whatever it is and tries to cram it into the size of the type in
<code>as &lt;type&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>When going from a larger size to a smaller size (in this case, from <code>u128</code> to the equivalent of <code>u32</code>) it simply cuts
off the front of the data, leaving the least significant bits.
((Show program))</p>
<h3 id="floating-points"><a class="header" href="#floating-points">Floating Points</a></h3>
<p>We've covered twelve different ways of storing whole numbers in Rust, but there are only two ways of storing numbers
with decimal points: <code>f32</code> and <code>f64</code>.</p>
<p>Floating point numbers are things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>zero point one two three</li>
<li>one point two three</li>
<li>one hundred and twenty-three point nothing</li>
</ul>
<p>They're called floating point because the decimal point can move around.</p>
<p>Your immediate thought here might be that you should use <code>f32</code> on 32bit systems, and <code>f64</code> on 64bit systems, but
actually this isn't the way to think about these numbers, and I literally only discovered this while writing this
chapter of the book!</p>
<p>To explain, floating points are not perfectly accurate. The bits of a floating point number are broken into parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>a sign, positive or negative</li>
<li>an exponent</li>
<li>and a fraction</li>
</ul>
<p>Without going into too much detail on floating points this gives us a way of expressing very large numbers and very
small numbers but not every number in between</p>
<p>(after all, there are an infinite number of numbers between zero and one).</p>
<p>Imagine using a floating point number to represent money.</p>
<p>Someone comes into a store to buy an item that costs five hundred and twenty dollars and four cents.</p>
<p>Somehow they have a coupon for five hundred and twenty dollars and two cents.</p>
<p>The remainder that they need to pay is 2 cents, right?
((Show code))</p>
<hr />
<p>If we expressed this in code using floating point numbers we don't get a perfect two cents!</p>
<p>Instead, if the currency you're representing uses "hundredths" for its minor currency like USD or GBP, then you can
(and maybe should) represent the total number of that, eg of cents for dollars or pennies for pounds, using integers
instead.</p>
<p>So when should you use floats?</p>
<p>Floating point numbers are great for more abstract mathematics where perfect precisions isn't strictly necessary, for
example, vectors, matrices and quaternions which are often used in applications like video games and scientific models.</p>
<p>As to which you should use, you might think that it comes down to architecture again, for example, a program targeting
a 32bit architecture should use an <code>f32</code> and a 64bit architecture should prefer an <code>f64</code>... but if that's the case,
where is the <code>fsize</code>?</p>
<p>Actually, 32bit architectures are usually designed to support 64bit floating point numbers just fine, the difference
between <code>f32</code> and <code>f64</code> is that regardless of architecture, <code>f32</code> is about 30% faster, and <code>f64</code> is more "fine grain".</p>
<p>To decide which to use you just need to decide between speed and accuracy</p>
<h3 id="characters"><a class="header" href="#characters">Characters</a></h3>
<p>In Rust, we have a special type that represents a single character called <code>char</code></p>
<p>I say char, some people say car, unlike stud though I'm not changing my ways on this one, I'm on old man dying on a
weird hill, deal with it</p>
<p>Char is always 4 bytes (32bits) in size and can be any valid "unicode scalar value" (which is to say, any character in
unicode that's not a control character).</p>
<p>In Rust a character is always written between single quotes, whereas string literals are always written between double
quotes.
((Show Code))</p>
<p>You can use any valid unicode character whether that's the upper or lowercase english letters A-Z, numbers 0-9, white
space characters, word characters from languages like Chinese and Japanese, emoji, or anything else that's a "unicode
scalar value".</p>
<p>We usually use characters in relation to finding things inside strings.</p>
<p>You can also turn strings into a collection of characters and vice versa, however it's important to note that a
character inside a string may not take up 4 bytes (for example, english letters and numbers only take 1 byte) because
of how strings are encoded, however, once turned into a character, they will take up four bytes.</p>
<h3 id="boolean"><a class="header" href="#boolean">Boolean</a></h3>
<p>There is only one boolean type in Rust: <code>bool</code>. It represents <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.</p>
<p>We often get boolean values through the use of comparisons between values. For example is a equal to b, or is c greater
than d, etcetera.</p>
<p>Boolean values are usually reserved for <code>if</code> statements, and this is a good thing to look out for as finding it else
where <em>might</em> be a sign that the code isn't written in the best way.</p>
<p>For example, functions almost never need a boolean parameter, this is usually a sign that you should have written two
functions.</p>
<h3 id="string-slices"><a class="header" href="#string-slices">String slices</a></h3>
<p>Our old friend the string slice!</p>
<p>The type for a string slice is <code>str</code>, but you'll never see anything with the <code>str</code> type, you will usually see this
as a reference to a string slice ampersand str, which makes it unique amongst the primitive types.</p>
<p><code>str</code> <em>should</em> always be a UTF-8 string, which means that the length of a string in bytes may not necessarily be the
same as its length in characters.</p>
<p>For example and don't worry about the code yet ((Show Code))</p>
<p>The character that represents my cat's name has a length of 3 bytes when encoded as a str, but the str is only one
character long.</p>
<p>Its also worth remembering that when you turn a string into characters, each of those characters will take up 4 bytes
of memory, even though inside the string they might have only taken up one byte ((Show code))</p>
<p>(again, don't worry about the code here its just to show the size):</p>
<p>The size of a string slice depends on what's in it, which is why you won't see it on the stack (string slices live in
either the compiled output as string literals, or on the Heap inside a String).</p>
<p>A string slice reference is made up of two pieces of data, a pointer to where the string slice starts, and a length,
both of which are of known size but depend on the system architecture.</p>
<p>Fun fact about that reference though: you might wonder if it's just a pointer and a length, does that mean you can
have a reference to a string slice that exists inside a string slice, and the answer is: yes! ((Show code))</p>
<p>Just be careful when taking a slice inside a slice to make sure that the sub slice is a valid UTF-8 string.</p>

<h3 id="arrays"><a class="header" href="#arrays">Arrays</a></h3>
<p>Arrays are a collection of a single type. You might see arrays in two forms, either as a sized array on the stack, or
as a reference to another collection (also called an array slice).</p>
<p>When sized, arrays are annotated with the type open square bracket T semicolon N close square bracket where <code>T</code> is the
type of every item in the array and <code>N</code> is its size. ((Show code))</p>
<p>For example here's an array of exactly 5 chars. It will exist on the stack</p>
<p>((Show code))
When referenced as an array slice, you do not need to specify the size because, just like with references to string
slices, the reference not only contains a pointer to the underlying data, but also contains the size. We write this in
the form ampersand square brackets T where <code>T</code> is the type of every item in the array.</p>
<p>((Show code))
You can access elements inside the array directly by using an index value between square brackets.</p>
<p>In Rust, indexing starts at 0 and the type of the index is always a <code>usize</code>.</p>
<h3 id="tuples"><a class="header" href="#tuples">Tuples</a></h3>
<p>Tuples are similar to arrays in that they are a collection of items, however, each item in the collection can be a
different type.</p>
<p>This adds some flexibility but also some restrictions.</p>
<p>For example, you can iterate over each item in an array, but not a tuple.</p>
<p>((Show code))
Tuples are written between brackets, and are only considered the same type if the types inside the tuple match.</p>
<p>((Show code))
Another difference from arrays is how you access a single item in the tuple, which you do with a dot, followed by
the number element you want. Again, this starts from 0.</p>
<p>There is a zero length tuple that is Rust's way to represent nothing, we call it the Unit Type.</p>
<p>It's zero bytes, does not exist on the stack at runtime, and unlike other languages with types like <code>null</code> or <code>void</code>,
can not be used interchangeably with other types.</p>
<p>You might use this type in conjunction with generics which we'll come to in a bit.</p>
<h3 id="structs"><a class="header" href="#structs">Structs</a></h3>
<p>Structs are similar to tuples in that they are a type made up of other types.</p>
<p>Unlike tuples they are named though, and they must be defined outside of functions.</p>
<p>There are three types of structs:</p>
<ul>
<li>structs with named fields</li>
<li>tuple structs</li>
<li>and unit structs.</li>
</ul>
<p>As we just covered tuples, lets quickly talk about tuple structs.</p>
<p>((Show code))
They look a bit like they're simply "named" tuples, and indeed they can be accessed the same way:</p>
<p>Similar to tuples, this kind of struct can be accessed with a <code>.</code> and a numbered value, <em>however</em> unlike tuples,
structs have a concept of "visibility".</p>
<p>Unless explicitly marked as public the fields of a struct are only accessible in the module in which it is defined, or
its descendents.</p>
<p>((Show code))
We'll talk more about modules later, however, to make the fields of a struct public, you can simply mark them as <code>pub</code>.</p>
<p>You don't have to make every field public though, if you'd like some parts of the struct to be public and others to be
private.</p>
<p>((Show code))
Named fields work pretty much the same as tuple structs except instead of having a numbered field, its named.</p>
<p>You can access the named field with a dot and the name.</p>
<p>Similar to tuple structs, fields must be explicitly marked as public to be accessible outside the module they were
defined in.</p>
<p>((Show code))
Unit structs are an interesting case that you probably won't find much use for until we get into more advanced Rust and
some of the cooler patterns and idioms that we use.</p>
<p>Like the Unit Type, a Unit Struct has no value and no size. They're most commonly used as a marker, but you can also add
functionality to them via traits.</p>
<h3 id="enums"><a class="header" href="#enums">Enums</a></h3>
<p>((Show code))
Enums are for when you want to represent one of a finite number of possible values.</p>
<p>For example say we want to represent the colors of a traffic light which can only be red, amber or green.</p>
<p>Many programing languages have this concept of enums, but what makes Rust enums especially awesome is that the variants
can additionally contain values.</p>
<p>We've already talked about two such enums <code>Option</code> and <code>Result</code> which are two of the most important and widely used
types in the entire ecosystem, and we'll talk more about them when we talk about Generic Types shortly.</p>
<p>((Show code))
As an example though, enums variants can be structured in either a tuple stype or a struct style:</p>
<p>In terms of memory usage, on the stack an enum will take up as much space as its largest variant, regardless of which
variant it actually is.</p>
<h2 id="generic-types"><a class="header" href="#generic-types">Generic Types</a></h2>
<p>Generics in Rust allow the creation of entirely new types at compile time by combining types together.</p>
<p>We've talked a bit about Option and how Rust uses it to represent Some value or None.</p>
<p>((Show code))
Option is an enum with two variants, it is literally just this:</p>
<p>Note that after the name of the enum we have <code>T</code> in triangle brackets.</p>
<p>The triangle brackets express that this enum has a type (or types) that can be decided later, the <code>T</code> is a marker for
that type.</p>
<p>((Show code))
For example, say we want to create a type that represents either a single character, or nothing.</p>
<p>We can use the generic Option type to build Option char.</p>
<p>When we specify the value as some character, Rust can infer that type.</p>
<p>If it's None though, we'd have to specifically tell the compiler what the type is either through a type annotation or
other means.</p>
<p>Normally when accessing the variants of an enum, you must use the name followed by the variant eg Option colon colon
Some R, however Option and Result are so ubiquitous that their variants are globally accessible in any Rust code.</p>
<p>Result is another generic we've covered before. which usually represents either the success or failure of a function.</p>
<p>((Show code))
It has two types that can be decided later <code>T</code>, which should represent what type of data you expected to get back, and
<code>E</code>, which will be the type of the Error.</p>
<p>((Show code))
We'll talk more about functions in a later video, but in order to explain Result in context, the following example shows
the fully described Result type as the return type of the function, which is how we'd typically use this enum...</p>
<p>Though, you wouldn't typically use a String as an Error type, and we'll talk more about that when we get to Error
handling later.</p>
<p>When we start talking about adding functionality to types, we'll also talk about how you can restrict what types are
allowed to be used in generics through the use of trait bounds.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a class="header" href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>That is (almost) everything you need to know about types!</p>
<p>The main thing we're still missing is ownership and traits, but we'll come to those when we talk about functions.</p>
<p>The main things to remember are:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have our primitive types that represent binary data. There's a lot of choice here, but that's a good thing!</li>
<li>We can represent more complex types with compound types</li>
<li>We can do the type equivalent "fill in the blank" using generics</li>
<li>We talked a bit about two of the most common generics
<ul>
<li>Option (representing something or nothing)</li>
<li>and Result (representing a successful value or an error)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the next video we're going to talk about controlling the flow of our program with branches and loops as well as
pattern matching and expressions, two of my favourite features of this language!</p>
<p>If that interests you, don't forget to like and subscribe</p>
<p>Between now and then, why not try experimenting with your own types!</p>
<p>And I'll see you next time</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="control-flow"><a class="header" href="#control-flow">Control Flow</a></h1>
<p>Ok, I know I said learning Rust wasn't hard, then threw two videos of how memory works and how data is represented,
but you've got that down now.</p>
<p>Today, we're on to actually writing some code, there's even some homework to look forward to!</p>
<p>Programs are typically executed one line at a time, this is called flow, but we can alter what the next line is with
control flow.</p>
<p>This series has a free accompanying book, in which you can find all the details for this tutorial, check the
description below.</p>
<p>My name is Daniel, welcome to IRISS.</p>
<h2 id="intro"><a class="header" href="#intro">Intro</a></h2>
<p>There are two main ways of controlling flow: branching and looping</p>
<p>Before we get into that though, lets talk about two of Rusts coolest features, which will come up a lot later,
patterns, and how blocks are also expressions.</p>
<h2 id="patterns"><a class="header" href="#patterns">Patterns</a></h2>
<p>Last time we talked about compound types.</p>
<p>Tuples, Structs, and Enums allow the construction of more complex data from less complex data.</p>
<p>However, if we want to break the data back into its component parts we can do that!</p>
<p>Patterns can be used to "destructure" compound data types like tuples fairly trivially: [[]]</p>
<hr />
<p>Destructuring with patterns also works for Tuple Structs, however, you need to specify the name of the struct like
you're doing a weird backwards struct instantiation. [[]]</p>
<p>The same thing also works for Structs with Named Fields: [[]]</p>
<p>Here we extract the structs named fields straight into variables of the same name as its easy and the
names were appropriate.</p>
<p>However, it might be better in the context of your program to name them something else.</p>
<p>We can rename the variables using colons, like naming x to width and y to height: [[]]</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you can't extract data from Enums this way as the value of an Enum is one of a set of, not only values,
but potentially subtypes or shapes or however you'd like to describe them.</p>
<p>Take for example the humble Option: [[]]</p>
<p>How can we extract a char from Option char if 5we don't know whether the variable is Some or None...</p>
<p>well, actually, we'll come to that soon.</p>
<h2 id="blocks-are-expressions"><a class="header" href="#blocks-are-expressions">Blocks are Expressions</a></h2>
<p>One of my favourite features in Rust is that code blocks (that's any code between curly brackets) can be used as
expressions</p>
<p>An expression in Rust is anything that could have a value.</p>
<p>So, for example, a + b is an expression where we're adding a to b which results in a value.</p>
<p>You will also use expressions like a equals equals b to compare whether the values of a and b are the same, this
results in a value of true or false.</p>
<hr />
<p>Usually you might use an expression as part of an assignment or an evaluation, for example "let c = a + b" or
"if a equals equals b", however, Rust also allows you to use a block (code between curly brackets) as an expression
<em>and</em> the final value of that block can itself be an expression.</p>
<p>In this admittedly contrived example, we create the variables a and b and add them together.</p>
<hr />
<p>Some cool things to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>a and b only exist within the code block, they're not accessible after</li>
<li>the lines with let have semicolons</li>
<li>the line with the expression a + b does not</li>
<li>c will be equal to the evaluation of the code block, which itself is equal to the result of a + b</li>
<li>the code block which c is equal to is also terminated with an exclamation because let can not be part of an expression</li>
</ul>
<p>Why is this so cool? Because branches, loops and even functions all use code blocks!</p>
<h2 id="if"><a class="header" href="#if">If</a></h2>
<p>The most basic form of branching is the if statement.</p>
<p>In its most simple form it's an IF followed by an expression followed by a code block.</p>
<p>Two differences to most other languages, the expression being evaluated by the if is not in brackets and code to be
executed must always be in a code block, even if its only one line.</p>
<p>The expression must evaluate to a boolean, either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.</p>
<p>If the expression evaluates to <code>true</code>, then the code in the block will be run, otherwise it won't be:</p>
<p>For example, we could create an expression that evaluates to a boolean by comparing if two numbers are the same, using
double equals: [[]]</p>
<p>If you want to run some code if the expression is <code>true</code>, but some different code if its <code>false</code>, then you can extend
<code>if</code> with <code>else</code>.</p>
<p>Here we compare if the first number is greater than the second number. [[]]</p>
<p>You can chain <code>if</code>/<code>else</code> statements to create more complex branches. [[]]</p>
<p>Remember though, code blocks, including those in <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> are themselves expressions. This means they can
effectively return their own values [[]]</p>
<p>Some important things to note:</p>
<ol>
<li>To make the code block an expression, the last line must have no semicolon</li>
<li>When we use let to set a value to the result of an expression, the expression must be terminated by a semicolon</li>
<li>All branches must evaluate to the same <em>Type</em>, even if they don't evaluate to the same <em>value</em></li>
<li>Doing big blocks of <code>if</code>/<code>else if</code>/<code>else</code> is a mess, there's a better way which we'll talk about in a moment!</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="pattern-matching-inside-if-and-else"><a class="header" href="#pattern-matching-inside-if-and-else">Pattern Matching inside <code>if</code> and <code>else</code></a></h3>
<p>There is another way you can branch with <code>if</code> that doesn't require a boolean expression, pattern matching.</p>
<p>Pattern matching is similar to our destructuring earlier, but now we can use it as a conditional!</p>
<p>There are two ways to do this <code>if let ...</code> and <code>let ... else</code>.</p>
<p>Let's go back to that Option from earlier: [[]]</p>
<p>In the line <code>if let Some(c) = maybe_yuki</code> we are pattern matching on the Option, if it matches the pattern of
<code>Some(&lt;variable&gt;)</code>, then we extract the contents of the <code>Some</code> into the <code>&lt;variable&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Within the block (and only within the block), the variable C has the value from inside the Some variant of the Option.</p>
<p>This may be easier to observe with our own enum type: [[]]</p>
<p>Again, this example is contrived, there are better ways to do this.</p>
<p>You can also do the opposite, branch if the pattern does not match, using <code>let ... else</code>.</p>
<p>The important thing to note here is that execution can not continue after the code block, you must exit the current
flow, whether that's returning from a function or breaking from a loop [[]]</p>
<h2 id="match"><a class="header" href="#match">Match</a></h2>
<p>This pattern matching stuff is really handy, right?!</p>
<p>Well the creators of Rust thought so too, so much in fact, they added a whole control flow mechanism around it!</p>
<p><code>match</code> is a bit like <code>if</code> in that it can branch, and act as an expression.</p>
<p>However, <code>match</code> can do a lot more than <code>if</code>, it will match against multiple possibilities, allows match guards for fine
grain control of pattern matching, and its exhaustive, meaning that a match <em>must</em> deal with every possibility.</p>
<p>Let's look at our Vector example again: [[]]</p>
<hr />
<p>First of all, you can see that this pattern is <em>much</em> cleaner than having a lot of <code>if let</code>s.</p>
<p>We could also use match as an expression: [[]]</p>
<p>What happens if we add another variant to the enum though? Well, that <code>match</code> statement will see that not every case is
handled, and cause an error. [[]]</p>
<hr />
<p>We can deal with this by either adding the missing case, or using underscore, which is a special variable that
immediately discards whatever is put into it and will match anything. [[]]</p>
<p>Patterns on match arms are tested from top to bottom, and you can also match on more specific patterns, like values:
[[]]</p>
<p>There's one more trick up match's sleeve which is match guards. Say we want to do something similar to the above, but
instead of matching on exactly zero, we want to match on values less than 10.</p>
<p>We could make an arm for every variant, or we could use a match guard which is like a mini if statement: [[]]</p>
<h2 id="loop"><a class="header" href="#loop">Loop</a></h2>
<p>The most basic loop is, well, <code>loop</code>.</p>
<p>When you enter a loop, the code inside it will run until it's explicitly told to stop. [[]]</p>
<hr />
<p>This might seem a little bit unhelpful, surely you never want to get trapped inside a loop forever, but actually, we
often want to keep a program or process running inside a loop.</p>
<p>You can manually exit the loop using the <code>break</code> keyword.</p>
<p>Like other languages, you can simply break from a loop, but remember that blocks can be expressions, and this applies to
loops too!</p>
<p>That means we can have a loop that does some work, and once the work is done, break with the value we want to take from
the loop.</p>
<hr />
<p>In this example, we run a loop until we find some cool number (note the use of if let), then break with that value.</p>
<p>The Type of found is a <code>u64</code> and by breaking with that value, the Type of the whole loop becomes <code>u64</code> too! [[]]</p>
<hr />
<p>Another useful keyword when looping is <code>continue</code>.</p>
<p>Imagine you have a series of things that need to be processed, but you can skip over <em>some</em> of those things.</p>
<p>Here, we'll continuously get images, and run a time-consuming <code>process_image</code> function, unless the image is an SVG,
in which can it will skip it. [[]]</p>
<hr />
<p>There's one more neat trick up Rust's sleeve.</p>
<p>As with most languages, Rust of course supports nested loops, but to aid with things like <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> it
also supports labels.</p>
<p>Labels start with a single quote and mark the loop they are for with a colon.</p>
<p>This very contrived example steps through a set of instructions.</p>
<p>Check the book for the code and see if you can work out what will be output</p>
<h2 id="while"><a class="header" href="#while">While</a></h2>
<p><code>loop</code> is great for programs that actually do want to try to keep running forever (or perhaps have many exit conditions)</p>
<p>We often only want to loop over something <code>while</code> something is true though.</p>
<p>The <code>while</code> loop takes an expression that evaluates to true or false.</p>
<p>The expression is checked at the start of each iteration through the loop, if it's true, the loop will execute. [[]]</p>
<hr />
<p>This is actually not a great way to loop over numbers, imagine if we forgot to add to counter!</p>
<p>Here's a different example where we call a function until we're happy with the result. [[]]</p>
<p>What's really cool though is that you can do all the tricks we've learned above, including pattern matching with
<code>while let</code>. [[]]</p>
<p><code>while let</code> is extremely useful, and we'll see it more in the future, particularly when we get to async await.</p>
<h2 id="for-in"><a class="header" href="#for-in">For In</a></h2>
<p>A very common reason for looping in software is because we want to loop over every item in a collection and perform the
same set of instructions for each.</p>
<p>This is where we'd use <code>for ... in ...</code>.</p>
<p>For In allows you to step through an <code>Iterator</code>, or anything that implements <code>IntoIterator</code>, both of which we'll talk
more about in a later video.</p>
<p>Simply put though, this lets us step over each item in a collection, stream or series of data</p>
<p>Here's an example where we step over every item in an array [[]]</p>
<h3 id="range"><a class="header" href="#range">Range</a></h3>
<p>Another neat Rust type that works really well here is the Range.</p>
<p>We haven't specifically covered Range yet but if you've been paying attention to the code samples throughout the last
few videos, you might have spotted a few!</p>
<p>Range's allow you to specify a "closed" or "half open" range of numbers... well...</p>
<p>Actually, Range's allow you to specify a range of anything so long as it implements the traits <code>PartialEq</code> and
<code>PartialOrd</code>.</p>
<p>I've personally never seen this done for anything except numbers and characters, but its worth pointing
out. We'll talk more about PartialEq and PartialOrd in a later video.</p>
<p>We write Ranges in the form start dot dot end, where <code>start</code> is inclusive and <code>end</code> is <code>exclusive</code>.</p>
<hr />
<p>This means that 2 dot dot 5 includes 2 but not 5.</p>
<p>If you want to create a range that includes the final number, prefix that number with <code>=</code>, eg 2 dot dot equals 5: [[]]</p>
<p>As mentioned, Range's can be "half open" which means you can get away with specifying only the start or the end.</p>
<hr />
<p>This is where the Type of the start and end really start to matter though. [[]]</p>
<p>A big warning here though: half open Ranges are dangerous when it comes to <code>for ... in ... </code> loops.</p>
<p>Ranges with no start can't be used at all, and Ranges with no end will continue to try to produce numbers beyond the
upper limits of the type being used at which point your program will crash.</p>
<hr />
<p>They're great though, if we just want to do something 10 times. [[]]</p>
<h2 id="homework"><a class="header" href="#homework">Homework</a></h2>
<p>The best way to learn anything is to practice it. For this section, I'd like you create a program call Fizz Buzz.</p>
<p>In Fizz Buzz we want to run through a series of numbers (say 1 to 100 inclusive). For each number:</p>
<ul>
<li>if the number is divisible by 3, print the word Fizz</li>
<li>if the number is divisible by 5, print the word Buzz</li>
<li>if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print FizzBuzz</li>
<li>otherwise, just print the number</li>
</ul>
<p>You can do this a few ways, but you'll need to loop over each number and then choose what to do with it with those
numbers.</p>
<p>As a starting point, you could use a range to generate the numbers, then use a <code>for ... in ...</code> loop to get
each number one at a time, then some <code>if</code>/<code>else</code> statements to get the output.</p>
<p>Can you work out any other ways to do it?</p>
<h2 id="next-time-2"><a class="header" href="#next-time-2">Next Time</a></h2>
<p>Next time we're going to look at functions.</p>
<p>We're also going to deal with what many people consider the hardest bit of Rust to deal with, Ownership, move semantics
and lifetimes.</p>
<p>Don't panic, I think... hope... I've got a great way to explain this one to you.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="functions"><a class="header" href="#functions">Functions</a></h1>
<p>Functions are reusable blocks of code.</p>
<p>They have inputs, usually perform some sort of process, then have an output.</p>
<p>We've been using a function called <code>main</code> to run all of our programs and examples so far.</p>
<p>This is a special function that is called as the program starts.</p>
<p>We've also used a few other kinds of functions and methods (special functions attached to data types) that are built into Rust.</p>
<p>We can make and use our own functions too though.</p>
<p>This series has a free accompanying book, in which you can find all the details for this tutorial, check the description below.</p>
<p>My name is Daniel, welcome to IRISS.</p>
<h2 id="preamble-4"><a class="header" href="#preamble-4">Preamble</a></h2>
<p>Functions can be pure, or impure.</p>
<p>A pure function takes zero or more inputs, does some processing and returns zero or more outputs.</p>
<p>This makes the function extremely predictable.</p>
<p>Given the same inputs they will always produce the same outputs, and nothing else within the system will change.</p>
<p>An impure function, might not always produce the same outputs given the same inputs, or may have side effects within the system, either changing something else in the system or having some other part of the system change what the function does.</p>
<h2 id="a-quick-note-on-mutability"><a class="header" href="#a-quick-note-on-mutability">A Quick Note on Mutability</a></h2>
<p>Up to now, we haven't needed to change any data once it's been created.</p>
<p>By default, all variables in Rust are implicitly "immutable", meaning that the values inside of them can not be changed.</p>
<p>This, for example, won't compile, we get an error that we can assign an immutable variable, but we can't change it.</p>
<p>Immutability is good because it prevents data from being changed by mistake which, going on the name of the variable in this example, seems like it's what's happened here it doesn't seem like <code>one</code> should contain <code>2</code>.</p>
<p>So we should try to use immutable variables as much as possible, but software is all about processing data.</p>
<p>If we could never mutate values, we'd always have to depend on creating values, which is fine for small data but imagine we're processing large data like an image.</p>
<p>Do we want to copy it every time we make a single pixel change?</p>
<p>You can explicitly opt in to mutability by adding the keyword mute (M U T) in front of the variable name.</p>
<h2 id="creating-and-calling-functions"><a class="header" href="#creating-and-calling-functions">Creating and calling functions</a></h2>
<p>Functions are defined with the <code>fn</code> keyword (short for function), followed by a name, followed by brackets <code>()</code> which may or may not contain parameters, possibly followed by an arrow <code>-&gt;</code> and a return type.</p>
<p>If no return type is specified the return type is the Unit Type, see our video on data types to learn more about that.</p>
<p>This part of the function is called the "function header".</p>
<p>The function is completed by a code block, code between curly brackets, which is also called the function body.</p>
<p>So lets create the simplest possible function:</p>
<p>This function is called <code>say_hello</code>, it has no parameters and does not return anything.</p>
<p>Because it writes to the terminal, this function is considered to be impure.</p>
<p>We can call the function using its name and empty brackets inside our main function.</p>
<h2 id="passing-parameters"><a class="header" href="#passing-parameters">Passing Parameters</a></h2>
<p>Let's get a little more advanced and give our function an input.</p>
<p>Inputs to functions are called parameters, and they live between the brackets in the function header.</p>
<p>we'll add a parameter called name, and specify that its type is a reference to a string slice.</p>
<p>After that we can use it like it's a variable inside the function body, so we'll use it in our print line.</p>
<p>Now we just need to update where we call our function to pass the parameter, as ever we'll use my cats name.</p>
<p>We can have multiple parameters too.</p>
<p>Parameters are ordered so when you call the function, you need to match the order they're specified.</p>
<p>Let's make a new function that greets two people.</p>
<p>In Rust, all parameters must be used when calling the function.</p>
<h2 id="returning-from-functions"><a class="header" href="#returning-from-functions">Returning from Functions</a></h2>
<p>Next we're going to move the side effect out of our function.</p>
<p>Instead of directly printing to the terminal from the function, we'll return the string we want to display and move the side effect to main.</p>
<p>We'll rename the function to reflect the change in behaviour</p>
<p>We'll add an arrow and the return type ,in this case <code>String</code>, to the function header</p>
<p>We'll create the String using the <code>format!</code> macro and store it in a variable <code>message</code></p>
<p>We'll return the <code>message</code> from the function, remember the code blocks can be expressions, we don't need to explicitly write <code>return</code> (though we can), we just need to make the thing we want to return the last bit of the block and forgo the semicolon</p>
<p>The variable isn't really necessary either, I just wanted to show you that the result of the format! macro is a String, now I've done that, lets cut the variable and return from the macro directly</p>
<p>We'll update the call site of the function to receive the variable greeting to the result of calling the function</p>
<p>Then we can use that variable in a print line in the main function</p>
<p>Now we have a pure function that takes an input, processes it, and returns an output.</p>
<h2 id="recursion"><a class="header" href="#recursion">Recursion</a></h2>
<p>In Rust, functions can call other functions, like how our main function called our create_greeting function in the last example</p>
<p>A function that calls itself is described as recursive.</p>
<p>Take for example this function will find the nth number in the fibonacci sequence</p>
<p>A quick side note, this function uses a boolean OR in the IF so the larger expression evaluates to true if either the left or right parts of the expression evaluate to true.</p>
<p>We also use the if/else as an expression so the return value of the function is equal to the value from the if/else blocks.</p>
<p>If the expression in the IF is true, then we return N, otherwise we return the result of calling the same function with new parameters.</p>
<p>Because we call find_fibonacci inside of find_fibonacci, this is a recursion.</p>
<p>Each time we call the function in this way, we add another layer on the stack.</p>
<p>The stack is finite, so if we give the function a large enough number, it will eventually run out of space in the stack, causing a stack overflow, and you'll see something like:</p>
<p>thread 'main' has overflowed its stack</p>
<p>For the advanced programmers watching, Rust does support "tail recursion" which is technique for turning a recursive function into a loop at compile time.</p>
<p>This not only minimises stack usage to effectively a single function call but is also much faster.</p>
<p>However, I think this is an overrated feature.</p>
<p>In any language that supports tail recursion, it's hard to guarantee the compiler will optimise in this way, and it's easy to break.</p>
<p>My recommendation is if you need to recurse a <em>lot</em>, then consider whether you can manually rewrite your function as a loop instead of depending on a compiler optimization.</p>
<h2 id="ownership---memory-management-primer"><a class="header" href="#ownership---memory-management-primer">Ownership - Memory Management Primer</a></h2>
<p>Variables in Rust have to live somewhere in physical memory.</p>
<p>This primarily comes down to the Stack, the Heap and the binary</p>
<p>For a deeper explanation, see our video on memory</p>
<p>The Heap, specifically, can be thought of as managed.</p>
<p>You ask the operating system to "allocate" you a block of memory to use for writing to and reading from</p>
<p>Once you're finished using that block of memory you "free" that block and return the memory to the operating system.</p>
<p>In some programming languages, this process is manual.</p>
<p>You have special commands for asking for memory to be allocated, and special commands for freeing it</p>
<p>This leads to some problems:</p>
<p>What happens if you try to use memory that wasn't allocated?</p>
<p>What happens if you try to use memory that you already freed?</p>
<p>What happens if you try to store more data than fits in the allocated block?</p>
<p>Not only is it surprisingly easy to make mistakes here, we're all human, the consequences can be severe:</p>
<p>around 70% of all security vulnerabilities today are caused by accidental misuse of memory.</p>
<p>In order to get around these problems, some programming languages use an automated method of memory management called
garbage collection.</p>
<p>In this method, you, the software engineer, don't have to think about the actions required to allocate or free memory.</p>
<p>Instead, as memory is allocated, the garbage collector built into the language, will monitor to see which parts of your program are actively looking at that bit of memory, through a process called reference counting.</p>
<p>Once the number of places using that data (the reference count) has dropped to zero, the garbage collector can safely free the memory.</p>
<p>This is much safer than manually managing the memory yourself, but comes with some of its own problems:</p>
<p>The garbage collector requires additional resources to manage memory</p>
<p>This includes CPU time to do the work but in some cases can also require significantly more memory</p>
<p>Managing memory by proxy is less efficient than managing it directly, meaning its slower</p>
<p>And you have limited to no control over what the garbage collector does or when it does it</p>
<p>This can have big negative impacts on performance at uncontrollable times</p>
<p>Rust's method of memory management is a little different.</p>
<p>It's low level, giving you the speed of manual memory management, but its mechanisms are hidden behind abstractions that mitigate its risks.</p>
<p>It's certainly not as easy to learn, but once you get your head around it, it makes a lot of sense.</p>
<h2 id="ownership---introducing-ownership"><a class="header" href="#ownership---introducing-ownership">Ownership - Introducing Ownership</a></h2>
<p>In Rust, all data is "owned".</p>
<p>When the variable that "owns" the data goes out of scope, the data is dropped.</p>
<p>This means that if the data was stored on the Heap, then that bit of memory is immediately freed.</p>
<p>Let's have a play with this, first, lets look at the scope aspect of ownership:</p>
<p>Here we create a variable <code>a</code> what we'll refer to as the outer scope</p>
<p>Then we start a new code block which creates a new scope we'll call the inner scope</p>
<p>We can use <code>a</code> in the inner scope just fine, as the inner cope is part of the outer scope</p>
<p>We can create and use a new variable <code>b</code> in the inner scope too.</p>
<p>However, when we close the inner scope, <code>a</code> will still work, as we're still in the outer scope but <code>b</code> is no longer available</p>
<p>Once a variable is out of scope, it can't be used.</p>
<p>If tried to compile this code, in the error output it tells you it "cannot find value <code>b</code> in this scope" and what
line we tried to use it on.</p>
<p>It tells us <em>exactly</em> what's wrong!</p>
<p>Rust's compiler messages are generally amazing, especially when it comes to working with ownership, so it's worth getting used to how Rust presents its errors.</p>
<p>Next, lets look at how data can only be "owned" by one thing at a time:</p>
<p>We'll create a string and put it into  our <code>a</code> variable</p>
<p>Then we'll assign <code>a</code> to <code>b</code></p>
<p>We can no longer use <code>a</code>, if we try to compile we see the error "value borrowed here after move"</p>
<p>The statement <code>let b = a</code> "moves" ownership of the string from <code>a</code> to <code>b</code>.</p>
<p>Normally we wouldn't "move" data in this way (spoilers: this is, after all, a video on functions), but it neatly shows that the data can't be owned by multiple variables at once.</p>
<p>What does Rust mean by "move" though?</p>
<h2 id="ownership---move-semantics"><a class="header" href="#ownership---move-semantics">Ownership - Move Semantics</a></h2>
<p>You might have noticed that we swapped from <code>char</code>s in the first ownership example to a <code>String</code> in the second.</p>
<p>This is because there are two mechanisms at play: "Move" and "Copy".</p>
<p>Let's try the same code with chars:</p>
<p>This time we set a to a char...</p>
<p>and the code works...</p>
<p>why didn't the String?</p>
<p>The reason for this is that <code>char</code> is Copy, that is to say that it has the <code>Copy</code> trait.</p>
<p>We'll talk more about Traits in a future video, but essentially Traits provide behaviour to Data and Data Types.</p>
<p>Things can have the <code>Copy</code> trait applied to them if they can be trivially copied and this usually (always?) means the data exists on the stack.</p>
<p>The reason for this is all that "allocating" and "freeing" memory on the stack we talked about earlier requires a non-trivial amount of time and resources.</p>
<p>When data has the Copy trait, instead of being moved from one variable to another, it's copied.</p>
<p>This mechanism on data that has the Copy trait is implicit.</p>
<p>Data that does not or can not implement Copy may still be duplicated if it implements the trait <code>Clone</code>, which provides the <code>clone</code> method.</p>
<p>A method is a function that's attached to some data or data type, we'll talk more about methods when we talk about Traits in the future.</p>
<p>This mechanism is explicit in that you have to call <code>clone</code> yourself.</p>
<p>String already implements the Clone trait, so lets use that to duplicate the data in our <code>a</code> variable instead of moving it.</p>
<p>This now works too!</p>
<p>You'll also note that we used a full fat <code>String</code> here, not a string slice reference.</p>
<p>Here's what that would look like:</p>
<p>Because <code>"hello"</code> exists inside the binaries data you can not "Own" it.</p>
<p>Ownership would imply that once its no longer used it can be freed, but as its part of the binary, that wouldn't make sense.</p>
<p>Instead, we just get a reference to where the value exists in memory.</p>
<p>This reference is also immutable, you can't change values in the binary.</p>
<p>Immutable references <em>are</em> Copy though, so setting <code>b</code> to <code>a</code> is a copy instead of a move.</p>
<p>But, what do move semantics have to do with functions?</p>
<h2 id="ownership---functions-and-ownership"><a class="header" href="#ownership---functions-and-ownership">Ownership - Functions and Ownership</a></h2>
<p>When we pass data into functions through the use of parameters, the data follows the rules of move semantics.</p>
<p>Let's go back to our <code>create_greeting()</code> function.</p>
<p>Instead of passing in a string slice reference, what would happen if we passed in a full fat String?</p>
<p>In this example, we move ownership of the data stored in the variable <code>yuki</code> into the parameter <code>name</code>.</p>
<p>This means after the function the variable <code>yuki</code> can no longer be used.</p>
<p>Because the <code>format!</code> macro does not take ownership of the data in <code>name</code>, we <em>could</em> return both the message <em>and</em> the original <code>String</code> data using a tuple.</p>
<p>Let's change the <code>create_greeting</code> function to return a tuple that includes both strings.</p>
<p>When the function returns we destructure the tuple (see the control flow video for more on that) into two new variables, <code>message</code> and <code>yuki</code>.</p>
<p>A quick note, this new <code>yuki</code> is a different variable from the old <code>yuki</code>, this is called "shadowing".</p>
<p>Unless you do the inside an inner scope, like we were doing earlier, this is functionally meaningless, just interesting.</p>
<p>Anyway, <em>this</em> is obviously a terrible way to deal with ownership.</p>
<p>We don't want to have to pass ownership back and forth just to use functions.</p>
<p>Going back to our original function, you can see that we are taking a reference to a string slice instead.</p>
<p>The <code>String</code> type can be "dereferenced" into a reference to a string slice</p>
<p>Remember the internal representation of a String is the same as a string slice</p>
<p>So we can create a reference to our full fat <code>yuki</code> String using an ampersand.</p>
<p>Let's say we wanted our function to modify the string instead.</p>
<p>Ideally we'd want to avoid modifying data that's passed to a function but sometimes that's not possible, if you need to do it you can pass a mutable reference.</p>
<p>In order to mutate greeting via a mutable reference, the variable itself must also be mutable</p>
<p>When we pass the reference, we are explicit that we are allowing the reference to be mutable too</p>
<p>The function takes a mutable reference to a String, not a string slice... string slices are not mutable, but Strings are.</p>
<p>Before we move on, one last note about references: you can have as many immutable references to a value as you like, OR a single mutable reference.</p>
<p>Immutable references are Copy, but Mutable references are not.</p>
<h2 id="ownership---lifetimes"><a class="header" href="#ownership---lifetimes">Ownership - Lifetimes</a></h2>
<p>So far so clear, but it turns out that keeping track of those references is actually quite hard.</p>
<p>Let's create a function that takes a reference to a string and returns two parts to that string:</p>
<p>We'll take a point at which we will to split the string</p>
<p>We're going to make sure that point is never greater than the length of the string in bytes</p>
<p>Then we'll split the string in two at that byte (starting from zero)</p>
<p>To do this, we use a Range to take a sub slice.</p>
<p>We discussed half open ranges last time, but this means starting from the beginning of input up to but not including the "up_to"th byte.</p>
<p>And this means starting from the "up_to"th byte and continuing to the end of input.</p>
<p>Also remember that because we're using bytes here there's a serious risk of splitting the string in the middle of a character... ideally, never do this.</p>
<p>The left and right parts of the split are returned in the tuple which we immediately destructure</p>
<p>The cool thing here is that the string isn't duplicated, the values <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> are references that point to the inside of our original input string!</p>
<p>How does Rust know that though?</p>
<p>Let's confuse it a bit.</p>
<p>Instead of splitting at a particular point, we'll find a sub string inside the input string, then split around that:</p>
<p>This example won't compile, we get the error: <code>expected named lifetime parameter</code>, what does that mean?</p>
<p>We also get guidance from the Rust compiler on how to fix our problem, and what it suggests will work, but once you understand the problem, you'll see there's a better way to solve it.</p>
<p>A lifetime is Rust's way of tracking reference usage.</p>
<p>A reference needs to be tied back to its owning variable and this relationship must be understood at compile time.</p>
<p>Let's tie what we know about ownership to what we know about the stack and heap.</p>
<p>Some data is stored on the stack, some is stored on the heap</p>
<p>Heap data is tied back to variables on the stack that "own" the heap data</p>
<p>As we enter a function, all the space required for the stack data is added to the top of the stack</p>
<p>Further functions go up the stack</p>
<p>As functions come to an end they are removed from the top of the stack</p>
<p>Owned data that is not returned down the stack is freed</p>
<p>When it comes to references, we need to make sure that a reference to owned data does not out live that owned data.</p>
<p>For example, lets create a string on the heap called <code>my_string</code>.</p>
<p>We'll then return a reference to that string, but not the string itself.</p>
<p>This would mean that when the function comes to an end, the variable <code>my_string</code> goes out of scope,
so the data that it owns on the Heap is freed...</p>
<p>What would happen if we used the returned reference now the data that it references has been freed?</p>
<p>Luckily Rust won't let us do this</p>
<p>In order to prevent this, Rust tracks the lifetimes of each reference and its owned data.</p>
<p>It can often do this automatically.</p>
<p>In the first version of our function, Rust can see that only one reference enters the function, no other references are in play, so Rust knows that the two references that are returned <em>must</em> be tied to the same data as the incoming reference.</p>
<p>In the second version of our function, we pass two references in, now Rust is now less sure about which data the returned references should be tied to.</p>
<p>The suggestion the Rust compiler gives us is to tie all the references to the same lifetime.</p>
<p>This actually is a valid approach as Rust will use the shortest living bit of data to tie the references to.</p>
<p>Let's do what it says.</p>
<p>Rust lifetimes are annotated with generic labels, remember labels from the last video?</p>
<p>If we're being lazy we might use a single lettered label like <code>'a</code>, though if a lot of lifetimes are at play it's definitely better to use longer, clearer labels.</p>
<p>We'll change the header of our function to include the lifetime <code>'a</code>.</p>
<p>First we tell Rust we want to use a lifetime by putting it inside triangle brackets after the function name.</p>
<p>Then we mark each reference with that lifetime.</p>
<p>You can run the above and see this example works just fine, however, it's not ideal.</p>
<p>We've tied all the references to the same lifetime, which Rust interprets as "whatever dies first".</p>
<p>Using a contrived inner scope again, we can create code that doesn't work.</p>
<p>We've confined our sub string to the inner scope.</p>
<p>When the inner scope ends, that data is freed.</p>
<p>You and I know that the left and right references are tied to the input variable in the outer scope, but we told Rust that it should tie all the lifetimes together.</p>
<p>Since the sub string lasts the least amount of time, that's the lifetime it used.</p>
<p>So when we try to compile we get "borrowed value does not live long enough"</p>
<p>To fix this problem we can either give sub_string a different lifetime annotation, for example "b" or just remove the lifetime annotation from the sub_string parameter.</p>
<p>Now everything works as we'd expect:</p>
<p>References and lifetimes get really tricky.</p>
<p>Here's how I like to think about them.</p>
<p>Imagine a person flying a kite.</p>
<p>The person is the owner of the data, regardless of where the data is actually stored</p>
<p>The kite is the reference, and the string (or kite line) tying them together is the lifetime.</p>
<p>The kite can go up and down the stack freely, but it can't go below where the person is standing, that's our equivalent of the ground.</p>
<p>Multiple people can fly their kites through the same functions, and each one has its own kite string (lifetime).</p>
<p>Its even possible to entwine the kite lines.</p>
<p>Imagine a function that takes two string references and returns the longest.</p>
<p>This is like a function that accepts two kites but only the largest is returned.</p>
<p>Because you don't know who that kite belongs to, it can't go below the person standing highest on the stack.</p>
<p>Lifetimes can be incredibly powerful, there's no need to fear them.</p>
<p>One amazing example is that say we have a string that contains some complex data, for example it could be a serialized format like JSON or YAML, or it could be something like an Advent of Code input string.</p>
<p>Lifetimes mean that you bring that String into your program, allocating the memory for it once, then turn it into a complex data structure.</p>
<p>So long as the original String exists, the data structure can need not allocate any further memory, which is incredibly efficient.</p>
<p>Here's an example with a User struct that has two properties, both of which are references to string slices.</p>
<p>The data for this struct is in a String.</p>
<p>When we parse the String, it can return a new User, where the references are both tied back to the original string.</p>
<h2 id="best-practices"><a class="header" href="#best-practices">Best Practices</a></h2>
<p>So here's my list of best practices when it comes to working with functions:</p>
<p>Create a function whenever a section of code can be described in a few words</p>
<p>The function name should describe what that code is doing</p>
<p>Functions should only do one thing, avoid big branches inside functions</p>
<p>Keep functions short, but not too short.</p>
<p>Functions should be set of instructions grouped together, too few, and it may not be worth the function, too many, and it may need to be broken down into more functions</p>
<p>Do not take ownership unless you expressly need to own the data</p>
<p><em>Try</em> to avoid mutable parameters</p>
<p>Be specific about your lifetimes, if using more than one or two, try naming them</p>
<h2 id="homework-1"><a class="header" href="#homework-1">Homework</a></h2>
<p>How did you get on with your control flow homework?</p>
<p>Here's my Fizz Buzz program</p>
<p>I created a Range, 1 to 100 (note the equals sign to make sure 100 is included)</p>
<p>I used that with a For In loop</p>
<p>I then used a match statement with match guards to check if the number was divisible by 3, 5 or both</p>
<p>And printed the relevant output</p>
<p>Did you manage it a different way?</p>
<p>If so, let me know in the comments.</p>
<p>This time I'd like you to create a function that splits our string like before, but instead of returning a left and right side it splits every part of the string.</p>
<p>There is already a split method on string slices, but I'd like you to only use find, and create a recursive function.</p>
<p>You'll need to use a collection type to store all the chunks created by the split, I suggest using <code>Vec</code> which is built into Rusts standard library.</p>
<p>A Vec is a variably sized array that you can push new items on to the end of using the <code>push</code> method.</p>
<p>To check whether your Vec contains the correct information after the program has run, use the <code>debug</code> macro (we'll talk more about how this works another time, all you need to know is it will work for a Vec of string slice references)</p>
<p>The header of your function might look something like this... but I'm not going to tell you what the life times should be</p>
<p>If your main function looks like this</p>
<p>then your output should look something like this</p>
<p>This isn't an easy task, and will require thinking about the lifetimes carefully.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="tests"><a class="header" href="#tests">Tests</a></h1>
<p>Tests. Are. Awesome.</p>
<p>They're my favourite bit of software engineering.</p>
<p>I'm sure many of you can relate, but I don't tend to trust humans telling me I'm doing my job well.</p>
<p>When a computer tells me I'm doing well at my job because I made a test pass though, oh that dopamine hits good.</p>
<p>A good test makes sure that the thing we're building does what we think it should do.</p>
<p>This series has a free accompanying book, in which you can find all the details for this tutorial, check the description below.</p>
<p>My name is Daniel, welcome to IRISS.</p>
<h2 id="intro-1"><a class="header" href="#intro-1">Intro</a></h2>
<p>Anecdotally I recently interviewed at a company where I professed my love of tests, and they told me flatly they don't write tests, they "move fast".</p>
<p>Later in the interview they admitted they were having morale issues because their engineers were constantly getting called out of hours to fix things.</p>
<p>So, it begs the question: are you moving fast if you have to keep going back to fix your old code?</p>
<p>Software engineers are not paid to write software, we're paid to solve problems.</p>
<p>Tests are what make sure we solved the right problem and by automating our tests we make sure we don't accidentally "unsolve" it further down the line.</p>
<h2 id="the-testing-pyramid"><a class="header" href="#the-testing-pyramid">The testing Pyramid</a></h2>
<p>There are many ways to test software, these largely fall into three categories that make up what we call the testing pyramid.</p>
<p>It's a pyramid to indicate that, although all tests are important, those lower down the pyramid should be laying the foundation for the others.</p>
<p>Not only should you have more of them, but they will provide the greatest feeling of safety and security.</p>
<h3 id="end-to-end-tests"><a class="header" href="#end-to-end-tests">End-to-End Tests</a></h3>
<p>End to End tests are designed to make sure that the user of the software you've created can complete full user journeys</p>
<p>For example, can the user open, edit and save a file in a desktop application or can a user add an item to a shopping cart and checkout of an ecommerce store.</p>
<p>End-to-End tests are the slowest form of test and lack depth, but they help add confidence that everything works together.</p>
<h3 id="integration-tests"><a class="header" href="#integration-tests">Integration Tests</a></h3>
<p>Integration tests check that the code you control works correctly with code that your program depends on that you don't control.</p>
<p>This would include things like databases or other data stores, web apis, library apis, etc.</p>
<p>Integration tests are also used if your software produces a public API.</p>
<p>Because of the communication component to these tests, these tests are also quite slow but you should use more of them than end-to-end tests.</p>
<h3 id="unit-tests"><a class="header" href="#unit-tests">Unit Tests</a></h3>
<p>Unit tests test a single unit of functionality.</p>
<p>These tests are the simplest and the fastest and should make up the bulk of your testing.</p>
<p>These tests are so important, that it is best practice to write them before you write the code you're going to test.</p>
<hr />
<p>For this video series, we're only going to cover Unit Tests.</p>
<p>That isn't to say that Integration Tests and End-to-End Tests aren't important, they absolutely are, and there are many good guides out there.</p>
<p>But, it is to say, that Unit Tests are <em>so</em> important, that they significantly impact how we communicate about Rust code.</p>
<p>This is particularly important for documentation which we'll talk more about that in the next video.</p>
<h2 id="introduction-to-modules"><a class="header" href="#introduction-to-modules">Introduction to Modules</a></h2>
<p>Unlike many languages, in Rust, tests live with the code that they're testing.</p>
<p>To explain this we need to talk about how code in Rust is organised with Modules.</p>
<hr />
<p>A Module is simply a container for other things, functions, type definitions, other modules, etc.</p>
<p>You could think of it like a physical container, though you can nest any number of containers together.</p>
<p>The contents of the module are private to that module unless explicitly marked as public with the <code>pub</code> keyword.</p>
<p>Private items can only be accessed inside that module or its submodules</p>
<hr />
<p>We define a module with the <code>mod</code> keyword and a name. There are then three ways to define what's inside that module:</p>
<ol>
<li>With a directory named the same thing as the module which contains the file <code>mod.rs</code></li>
<li>With a file in the same directory named the same thing as the module</li>
<li>Inside curly brackets</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>If the module exposes anything publicly, you can then reference those things with the path to the module and the name of the thing you're referencing separate by double colons.</p>
<p>Sound familiar?</p>
<p>It should, this is how we've been accessing Rust's standard library. For example, the <code>stdin</code> function is inside the <code>io</code> module, which itself is available inside the <code>std</code> library module.</p>
<hr />
<p>We access that function using stud :: io:: standard in.</p>
<p>We can also use the <code>use</code> keyword to simplify this a bit, for example, we can "use stud io standard-in"</p>
<p>Then we can use standard in without having to use the full path to the module each time.</p>
<h2 id="test-modules"><a class="header" href="#test-modules">Test Modules</a></h2>
<p>In Rust, we typically create a test module near the code that is being tested.</p>
<p>Let's say we want to test some of the split functions we wrote in the last video.</p>
<hr />
<p>I've renamed them a bit, so we can have all of them in the same file.</p>
<p>First we start by creating a module to test these functions in the same file as the functions exist</p>
<hr />
<p>As long as nothing in the <code>tests</code> module is used in your main program it shouldn't appear in your final binary, however, this isn't good enough.</p>
<p>There's a risk we might make a mistake of course, but even without that, the module will still be processed by the compiler in order to do things like type checking.</p>
<p>We only care about this module when we're running our tests and Rust provides us a way to tell the compiler that too, the configuration attribute <code>cfg</code>.</p>
<p>Attributes are one of Rusts many meta programming tools which we'll cover more in the future at increasing difficulty levels.</p>
<hr />
<p>For now, the <code>cfg</code> attribute allows us to tell the Rust Compiler (<code>rustc</code>) <em>when</em> we want to compile something.</p>
<p>There are many, many ways to use conditional compilation, but for tests its pretty simple, we only want the module compiled when we're building tests.</p>
<p>The <code>cfg</code> has a "predicate" to identify this simply called <code>test</code>.</p>
<p>So by adding the <code>cfg</code> attribute with the <code>test</code> predicate, rustc will ignore the module unless its explicitly building the tests.</p>
<h2 id="writing-tests"><a class="header" href="#writing-tests">Writing Tests</a></h2>
<p>Now we're ready to write our first test.</p>
<p>A test is simply a function that we mark with another attribute <code>#[test]</code>.</p>
<p>This attribute tells Rust to run this function as part of the test suite when we run <code>cargo test</code>.</p>
<hr />
<p>Here's a test that won't pass.</p>
<p>The <code>assert!()</code> macro takes either one or two parameters.</p>
<p>The first parameter which is not optional is a boolean value, or something that evaluates to a boolean.</p>
<p>If this boolean is false, then the assertion will cause a panic, and the test will fail.</p>
<hr />
<p>The second, optional parameter allows us to annotate the assertion, which can help us more easily determine which (if any) assertion failed in a test.</p>
<p>This is awesome when we create more thorough tests with more assertions.</p>
<p>You will find that people don't use this as much, I'm guilty of this too, but I do recommend making an effort to describe each specific assertion.</p>
<p>The people you work with, as well as future you, will appreciate the effort.</p>
<hr />
<p>There are three main assert macros:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>assert</code> asserts value is true or panics with optional message</li>
<li><code>assert_eq</code> asserts left is equal to right or panics with optional message</li>
<li><code>assert_ne</code> asserts left is NOT equal to right or panics with optional message</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>There are a couple of restrictions with the assert macros.</p>
<p>Values used must implement <code>PartialEq</code> and <code>Debug</code>.</p>
<p>Most built in types already implement both, and we'll talk about how to implement them for your own types in the Traits video.</p>
<p>To run tests in our project we use <code>cargo test</code>.</p>
<p>When we do that for this test, we should see the this.</p>
<hr />
<p>This top bit is a summary of all the tests, then we get a breakdown of each test that failed.</p>
<p>You can see that we get both the line where the test failed in addition to our failure message.</p>
<p>The line number is why a lot of people skip the message, but it can still be useful to help provide context before we need to look up the line.</p>
<h2 id="testing-our-code"><a class="header" href="#testing-our-code">Testing our code</a></h2>
<p>Let's move on to writing our actual tests, we'll start with <code>split_at</code>.</p>
<p>Before we can write a test, <code>split_at</code> is not part of the <code>tests</code> module, so we need to make it available inside.</p>
<p>We can do that with the <code>use</code> statement in one of two ways, either <code>use super::split_at</code> or <code>use super::*</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>super</code> keyword simply means the module above this one, which for your unit tests should be the module you're writing tests for.</p>
<p>We can either bring just the one function in, or we can bring in everything available in that scope.</p>
<p>The idiom here is to <code>use super::*</code> as it will bring in everything that needs testing, and hopefully even if it brings in things you aren't using it won't pollute the test module too much.</p>
<hr />
<p>With our test, lets use "Hello world!" as the input string,</p>
<p>and we'll split at 3.</p>
<p>So we can expect the left side of the split to be "Hel",</p>
<p>and the right side to be "lo world!"</p>
<p>I've added some context to our asserts, so we can quickly see if anything went wrong.</p>
<p>When we run <code>cargo test</code>, everything passes, which is great!</p>
<hr />
<p>However, because we're working with strings, we should check strings that contain more than just ascii characters.</p>
<p>Let's write another test for <code>split_at</code>.</p>
<hr />
<p>This is exactly the same but we've used "Hello World" in Japanese... hopefully, let me know if I got it wrong in the comments.</p>
<p>Now when we run the tests, this test fails.</p>
<hr />
<p>This is where testing gets really nuanced, we need to test our expectations of the behaviour, not that the code did what we programmed it to.</p>
<p>In the test, I wrote that I expect the result to be the first 3 characters, but in the last video, I mentioned this would return a length in bytes.</p>
<p>The Japanese character "ko" is 3 bytes in length, which is why it's the only character that's returned.</p>
<p>If we asked for two bytes instead, the split would fall inside a character and this function would panic and crash our program.</p>
<p>Regardless of that though, from the name <code>split_at</code> I think number of characters is the right behaviour here, so lets fix our function.</p>
<hr />
<p>Don't worry too much about this yet, we're going to cover iterators in a future video but to explain the fix:</p>
<p><code>.chars()</code> returns an iterator over each character in the string.</p>
<p>We then use <code>.take()</code> to only take (at most) the number of characters we wanted to split at from that first iterator.</p>
<p>We then <code>.map()</code> over each character and get its size in bytes, which turns the character into a usize number.</p>
<p>Finally, we <code>.sum()</code> the iterator which adds every number in the iterator together.</p>
<hr />
<p>This turns the length in chars into a new length in bytes and will be correct regardless of what size in bytes those characters are.</p>
<p>This is now safe to use to create our sub slices as the byte count won't fall inside a character.</p>
<p>We no longer need to check the bounds of <code>split_at</code> either, because the maximum size will be the full length of the string even if split_at was longer than the string.</p>
<p>Let's rerun our tests...and now this test works too!</p>
<hr />
<p>Let's quickly write the tests for <code>split_around</code> and <code>split_around_many</code>.</p>
<p>You'll notice that these functions already work with multibyte strings.</p>
<p>This is because we're looking for the start and end of substrings so we already know that the substrings won't happen in the middle of a character.</p>
<p>Now all our tests are working, doesn't that feel great!</p>
<p>But... what if I told you: we just did all of this backwards 😲</p>
<h2 id="test-driven-development"><a class="header" href="#test-driven-development">Test Driven Development</a></h2>
<p>Hopefully, you're eager to write a load of code and then write a load of tests, but wait!</p>
<p>As we alluded to at the beginning of the video, and again halfway through, the point of tests isn't to test that your code does what you think it does, it's to make sure it does what it's supposed to do.</p>
<p>As our <code>split_at</code> function showed, its a good idea to decide what you think that function should do before you write it.</p>
<p>The best way to achieve this is to work out what your code is supposed to do, then write the test, then write the code.</p>
<p>This is called Test Driven Development. Let's try it out!</p>
<hr />
<p>We'll create a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome (a word that's the same forwards and backwards).</p>
<p>We'll start by writing our test.</p>
<p>We'll check whether the function flags "kayak" and "racecar" as palindromes, and flags "wood" as not a palindrome.</p>
<p>Before we can run the test, Rusts type system won't let us compile the program without the function existing.</p>
<p>We don't want to write the functionality yet so we'll create the function header and use the <code>todo!()</code> macro</p>
<p><code>todo()!</code> is a handy little marker that we use to say we are intending to deal with this soon.</p>
<p>It always panics so Rust knows our function doesn't need to return anything.</p>
<p>We can run our tests now and see that they fail, lets write the code.</p>
<hr />
<p>Like earlier, we'll get an iterator for each character in the string.</p>
<p>We'll clone this iterator and reverse it to get a second iterator that goes backwards through the string.</p>
<p>Again, don't worry too much about the hows and whys of iterators yet, just go with it.</p>
<p>We can zip the two iterators together, and ccompare each element inside them.</p>
<p>If every element in each iterator is equal to the other, then the word is the same forwards and backwards.</p>
<p>Now when we run our tests they pass.</p>
<hr />
<p>We can now submit our code to a colleague for review.</p>
<p>[Exit left]</p>
<hr />
<p>[Enter right]</p>
<p>Hi Indra, sorry to interrupt, could you review my code?</p>
<p>Looks good to me but while race car is a palindrome, its two words, not one.</p>
<p>Oh hey, yeah, thanks, be right back</p>
<p>[Exit right]</p>
<hr />
<p>[Enter left]</p>
<p>So lets update our test.</p>
<p>All we need to do is add a space to race car.</p>
<p>Now the test fails again, lets fix it.</p>
<p>We'll update our first iterator to filter out anything that's not alphanumeric.</p>
<p>That'll deal with whitespace and any other punctuation too.</p>
<p>We only need to update the forward iterator because the effect of the filter is cloned.</p>
<p>Our tests pass again, so lets go back to the review</p>
<p>[Exit left]</p>
<hr />
<p>[Enter right]</p>
<p>Hi Indra, how does it look now?</p>
<p>I should have thought of this earlier, but names like Anna are also Palindromes, you should check for that.</p>
<p>Great idea, thanks!</p>
<p>[Exit right]</p>
<hr />
<p>[Enter left]</p>
<p>Lets update our test again. And again our tests fail, that's good! Lets update our code.</p>
<p>Now the obvious thing to do here is to lowercase all of the letters BUT in some languages, an uppercase letter might have multiple lowercase variants depending on how its used.</p>
<p>If we map over each character in the string and lowercase it, we actually get another iterator that contains each possible lowercase letter.</p>
<p>This means we now have an iterator of iterators.</p>
<p>We can get back to an iterator of characters by using the flatten method.</p>
<p>And our tests pass again.</p>
<hr />
<p>This function still isn't perfect, honestly, but we're going to leave it here.</p>
<p>If you want to keep working on it, its worth looking at diacritics as well as the difference between balanced and unbalanced palindromes.</p>
<p>You may need to rely on external crates for more nuanced control of unicode characters.</p>
<hr />
<p>For Test Driven Development, the main thing I want to emphasize is that at each stage:</p>
<ul>
<li>we think about what we want to achieve</li>
<li>write or modify a test to represent that expectation</li>
<li>then work on the functionality until the test passes</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-many-tests"><a class="header" href="#how-many-tests">How many tests?</a></h2>
<p>The perennial of questions when it comes to testing: How many tests should a good test writer write if a good test writer could write good tests?</p>
<p>The important thing here is "coverage".</p>
<p>We usually measure coverage by lines.</p>
<p>Each time we run a test, we can look to see if a line was run, if it was we call that "covered".</p>
<hr />
<p>Take for example this really silly function.</p>
<p>If we only test this function by giving it a number greater than 0, we'll only "cover" the line first branch of the <code>if</code>, we miss the fact there is a mistake in the second branch.</p>
<hr />
<p>So what percent coverage should you aim for?</p>
<p>Anecdotally, when I was creating my own API framework in PHP, I decided I wanted to get 100% coverage, that is, every line should have a test that hits it.</p>
<hr />
<p>The very last line that was uncovered was, in it entirety, this.</p>
<p>I wondered if it was worth the effort, decided it was.</p>
<p>The reason this was the last uncovered line was that it was part of a nested <code>if</code>.</p>
<p>I'd tested what happens if you went into both <code>if</code>s, what happens if you didn't go into the first, but not what happens if you went into the first, but not the second.</p>
<hr />
<p>I wrote the test and... found a bug so severe that I had to rewrite almost a third of the framework.</p>
<p>Should have written the tests first, right?</p>
<p>My personal feelings are that you as an engineer should strive for 100% coverage of your code.</p>
<p>As a manager or engineering lead though, test coverage is a terrible metric.</p>
<p>Test coverage doesn't tell you if the test was any good.</p>
<p>If you make arbitrary metrics like this, you're not improving code quality, engineers will write tests that meet that metric, but don't for-fill the reason we want tests in the first place which is to answer: "does this code do what we want it to do?".</p>
<p>As an engineer, it's a matter of pride. Get your code right now, and you won't have to deal with it later.</p>
<p>As a leader, make sure your engineers are encouraged to be the best they can.</p>
<p>That means giving them the time to write tests first, giving them access to the resources they need to learn how to write the best tests, etc.</p>
<h2 id="homework-2"><a class="header" href="#homework-2">Homework</a></h2>
<p>We've already let on how you can solve last chapters homework</p>
<p>We only needed one lifetime to represent the link between the input string slice and the string slices inside our vector.</p>
<hr />
<p>For a cleaner API though you could keep our recursive function private and expose a public function that creates the
vector for us.</p>
<p>Because we have control of the vector in this example we can make sure we create a vector with a capacity that is at least as large as the maximum possible entries in it.</p>
<p>This is useful as when you create a new Vector in Rust it has a default size, and any time you try to add an item to a vector that is already full, Rust will allocate the memory for a new larger vector in the background, copy the data from the old location to the new location, then free the memory in the old location.</p>
<p>This is very time-consuming.</p>
<hr />
<p>For the homework this time, I would like you to write the tests for, and then implement the code for the following requirements in this order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a function that will reverse the words in an English sentence.</li>
<li>If the string started with a capital letter, it should still start with a capital after the words are reversed.</li>
<li>If the string starts or ends with whitespace, it should be removed (trimmed) from the returned String.</li>
<li>If the string contains more than one sentence, the function should return an error, though for now, that error can be the unit type.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>Your function will need to allocate memory and should probably have a header like this.</p>
<p>I've linked to the documentation for String and Result in the description of the video which should help.</p>
<h1 id="going-forward"><a class="header" href="#going-forward">Going forward</a></h1>
<p>As I mentioned, after this chapter we will be talking about Rust differently.</p>
<p>This will primarily be by using the assert macros to state what a value <em>should</em> be rather than printing it to the screen.</p>
<p>For example, one of our earlier code examples looks like this.</p>
<p>We printed the values of x and y to the screen.</p>
<p>From now on, we'll write our examples like this, which, now you've seen the assert macros is cleaner and easier to understand.</p>
