## Intro

Rust is an amazing language, ecosystem and community.

In fact, its probably my favourite language, ecosystem and community.

But nothing is perfect so here's 5 things I think Rust should steal.

Let's start with the obvious, and ramp things up to some very my hot takes.

## Namespaced packages

## Official Program Interpreter

## Official async Runtime

## Automatic Atomic Referencing with Copy on Write

## Daniel is a liar

## Outro

I hope no one takes this list too seriously.

Rust is a fantastic, incredibly well designed language, with brilliant maintainers and contributors who just keep adding more amazing features!

But, in your perfect world, even if it makes not reasonable sense, what would you have Rust steal, and what trade offs would you make?
