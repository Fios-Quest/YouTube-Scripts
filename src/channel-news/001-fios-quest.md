# Long Live Fio's Quest

It had to happen eventually, Rust, simply is dead. Let's take a moment  ... Ok, that's enough, Rust simply is dead, long live Fio's Quest.

== Fio Jump

That's right, Rust, simply is becoming Fio's Quest, and Fio is that little crab.

The TL;DW: is that you've all been so amazing that, at some point this little side project might actually start making a small amount of money, so I wanted to get ahead of that.

I made a little company, and I've set up a Discord so that we can build our community further! 

I have also set up a Patreon, but here's the deal, please don't join that unless you can afford to.

2024 has been the worst year for tech industry workers since 2001, so only join the Patreon if you're currently earning and want to support what I'm doing.

I'm not planning on paywall-ing anything, so you won't miss out, the only benefits are early access to ad-free videos, and, depending on tier, name in credits.

IRISS will be continuing, we've barely scratched the surface of what's planned, and I have more ideas for the future too, including some non-Rust generalist videos.

There's a new website, and I'm making sure all links from the old website direct to the new one.

That's all the news, and if that's all you needed, thank you being here, I'll see you in the next video.

But, for the curious, I thought I'd take this opportunity talk a bit about how we got here.

## About the channel

I'd actually wanted to make the Idiomatic Rust In Simple Steps book for years and after taking a voluntary redundancy in December I finally had the time and resources to work on it.

At the same time I was getting increasingly frustrated with the "Rust is hard" rhetoric not just from Rust skeptics but worse from within our own community.

I don't think this message helps anyone, it's feels like we're patting ourselves on the back for our achievements while putting off others from joining us.

That's not to say Rust is easy, just that I don't think it's significantly more difficult than any other language.

All programming is challenging, but you can learn to do it if it's something you're interested in.

There are a lot of excellent resource to learn Rust, but I wanted to give people another way to learn, something different, something... simpler.

So, with the support of my partner "The Curious Library", and my good friend "Many Learn", I decided the best way forward was backing the book up with a YouTube channel,and with that, "Rust, simply" was born.

So I need to do few big thank-yous:

Thank you to the Curious Library who helped me with equipment and gave me my first crash course on video editing.

Thank you to Many Learn who helped with branding and made my early visions for Fio look less like they were designed by someone who definitely should not be a designer.

And thank you all, you helped me grow the channel much faster than I expected, and made everything I was doing feel worth-while.

## Fio's Quest

You probably didn't know that my little crab friend wasn't Ferris unless you'd been to the Rust, simply website and looked at the code.

Fio was my vision for representing a simpler Rust.

But Rust isn't the only language that's hard, all programming is hard if we're honest about it, but that doesn't mean people can't do it.

So, Fio is on a Quest to help people learn how to program. Yes it can be difficult and frustrating at times, but Fio believes in you, and so do I.

For now, we'll keep going with Rust, but I do plan to add more generic programming content in the future.

If the channel grows a lot I have bigger plans too, but we'll see how it goes.

## Thank you

Once again, thank you for coming on this journey with me, I look forward to seeing where it takes us!

Don't forget to drop by the Discord, link in the description be... maybe not below anymore, YouTube moved it, so I'm going to have to change my IRISS intro's from now on.

But, to end as we usually begin

My name is Daniel, welcome to Fio's Quest.
